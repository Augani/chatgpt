   "Content": "The Agricultural Development Bank (ADB) PLC, as part of its two-year corporate strategy, embarked on an aggressive recovery exercise, leading to the successful recovery of over GHȼ500 million Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) in just nine months.\n\nThe actual total amount recovered from January to September 2024 stands at GHȼ514.99 million.\n\nThe Bank’s NPLs portfolio is largely made up of years of bad legacy loans.  In a bold step to addressing this, management took measure to resource the Bank’s Recovery Department to ensure aggressive recovery of all non-performing loans as part of its 360-degree recapitalisation agenda.\n\nThe achievement, by the Management and Staff, is a testament to the Bank’s unwavering commitment to cleaning its books, fostering prudent lending practices and robust risk management, whilst also protecting its customers and upholding best practices.\n\nAccording to the Managing Director (MD) of ADB, Alhassan Yakubu-Tali who is less than two years in office, the Bank’s recovery strategy coupled with the expertise and perseverance of the Recovery Department are the results of the impressive feat which has helped enhance shareholder value.\n\nThe Bank’s improved risk management practice has also gone a long way to significantly reduce its non-performing loans, engender confidence, and strengthened its financial stability.\n\n“Our proactive approach to loan recovery has paid off. We will continue to work closely with regulatory bodies to ensure the integrity of our loan portfolio and maintain the highest standards of risk management.\n\n“The aggressive recovery exercise so far has greatly impacted the Bank’s operations, augmented our comprehensive recapitalisation agenda, and has put the Bank on the path of sustained growth and profitability,” he emphasised.\n\nThe General Manager (GM) in charge of recoveries, Sylvia Nyante stated that the successful recovery rate reflects the commitment of all stakeholders to ensure the achievement of the Bank’s recovery objectives.\n\n“Management took a bold decision as part of strategy to focus on recovery which is yielding significant results,” Madam Sylvia said.\n\n“The objective of this exercise is to ensure total recovery of all historical NPLs, and so we want to thank all our stakeholders and customers for their support in this process so far. We will continue to intensify our collaborative efforts with all stakeholders for a successful exercise,” Madam Sylvia further added.\n\nThe Agricultural Development Bank PLC is one of the biggest universal banks in the country, and a leader in agribusiness financing. The Bank has recorded strong financial performance from all indicators including deposits, profitability and asset growth. It also won several five (5) star awards at the recently held CIMG Customer Satisfaction Index Report Launch and Awards night.",

   "Url": "https://thebftonline.com/2024/10/15/blame-shipping-lines-for-high-cost-of-goods-giff/",
   "source": "Business & Financial Times",
   "Content": "The Ghana Institute of Freight Forwarders (GIFF) has attributed the high cost of goods in Ghanaian markets to the actions of shipping lines operating within the country.\n\nAccording to GIFF, the arbitrary and excessive charges imposed by these shipping lines over the years have significantly contributed to the increased cost of goods on the market. Consequently, the ripple effect includes high inflation, reducing traders’ profit margins, and eroding consumers’ purchasing power.\n\nSpeaking on ‘Eye on Port’, an authoritative port and maritime television programme, the Chairman of the Tema Chapter of GIFF, Forwarder Jonny Mantey, expressed concern over the growing number of administrative charges levied on shippers by some shipping lines. He described these charges as not only difficult to comprehend but also outrageous in nature.\n\nMr. Mantey expressed concern regarding the way shipping lines establish local administrative charges, noting that the process lacks transparency and consistency.\n\n“From the Port of Origin, where goods are purchased, administrative charges are levied. However, when the goods arrive at Tema or Takoradi Port, additional administrative fees are charged by the same shipping line. The frustrating part is that these local administrative charges are pegged in dollars,” Mantey explained.\n\nHe noted that the demonstration held on Tuesday, 24th September 2024 should be a wake-up call to all shipping lines operating in the country including Intermodal Shipping Agencies Ghana Limited, Arkas Line, Maersk Line, Mediterranean Shipping Company, Gold Star, ZIM Shipping Lines, Grimaldi, Messina Lines, Pacific International Line (PIL), UNICARGO, Breadbox Shipping Lines, Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL), CMA-CGM, Grimaldi Ghana Limited, and Maersk Line.\n\nHe drew a comparison between Ghana’s practices and those in other countries, noting that in many places, charges are typically based on the importer or exporter’s Bill of Lading (BL)—a crucial document that details the goods being shipped. In Ghana, however, shippers are charged per container, which presents a stark contrast.\n\n“This means if you have 10 containers, you are charged 10 times, and even then, the size of the container determines the cost you pay. This is unconscionable. Why should I be charged per BL globally, but in Ghana, the regime is per container?” he questioned.\n\nMr. Mantey emphasised that such practices inflate the cost of goods, as these additional charges are ultimately passed on to consumers, exacerbating economic challenges for the nation.\n\nIn response, an Executive Member of the Ship Owners and Agents Association of Ghana (SOAAG), Adam Imoro Ayarna, explained that every shipper has a contract with the shipping line responsible for transporting their goods, and the shipping lines’ actions conform strictly to these contracts.\n\n“There is a contract of carriage, and if we want to understand any charges, it is outlined there. These charges have been advertised for all to see,” Ayarna noted.\n\nAyarna suggested that shippers share their contracts with cargo owners to help them make informed decisions regarding their shipments. He added that shipping lines are open to negotiating charges with individual shippers.\n\nMr. Mantey, however, maintained that shipping lines and all players within the commercial shipping sector must adhere to the governing laws of the regulator, the Ghana Shippers Authority (GSA). He emphasized that negotiating all charges with the GSA is crucial to maintaining fairness and transparency in the shipping sector.\n\nThe GSA is confident that the recently passed Ghana Shippers Authority (GSA) Act 2024, along with its preceding Legislative Instrument (L.I.), will address many, if not all, of the concerns raised. This new legal framework aims to create a more equitable and transparent shipping industry in Ghana.\n\nThe GSA has indicated during its stakeholders engagements on the passage of the Law that it remains open and encourages all stakeholders to engage in dialogue and collaboration to ensure that diverse perspectives are considered. The GSA is confident that working together, Ghana can well position itself as the preferred shipping hub in the sub-region and promote sustainable growth in the commercial shipping sector.",

   "Url": "https://thebftonline.com/2024/10/15/african-countries-face-economic-strain-from-proposed-maritime-carbon-tax-report-warns/",
   "source": "Business & Financial Times",
   "Content": "A new report by three Africa-focused policy organisations warns that a proposed global carbon levy on maritime shipping could have severe economic consequences for African countries, exacerbating food insecurity and driving up the cost of living if implemented without adequate safeguards.\n\nThe report, titled ‘Navigating Climate Action: Assessing the Economic Impacts and Trade-offs of a Shipping Carbon Tax for African States’, was released by the Africa Policy Research Institute (APRI), Firoz Lalji Institute for Africa at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and African Future Policies Hub (AFPH).\n\nThe report emerges in context of the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) commitment to reducing shipping emissions to net zero by 2050.\n\nWhile decarbonisation of the shipping industry is seen as essential for global climate goals, the report notes significant concerns for African economies – which rely heavily on maritime trade. Without measures to cushion the impacts on developing regions like Africa, the proposed carbon tax could amplify existing economic vulnerabilities, the report says.\n\nUsing the Global Trade Analysis Project Energy-Environmental (GTAP-E) Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, the report assesses potential economic impacts of the shipping levy on African countries.\n\nThe findings suggest that the levy will disproportionately affect African countries by raising freight costs, leading to higher prices for essential goods. According to the report, maritime shipping services within Africa could decline by as much as 7 percent while global prices for agricultural and processed food commodities could rise by 0.011 percent and 0.013 percent respectively.\n\nThese price increases are expected to have a direct impact on food security, as many African countries depend heavily on imported food. “Almost 90 percent of Africa’s global trade is conducted by sea.\n\nThis heavy reliance on shipping makes African nations particularly vulnerable to shifts in the maritime sector,” said Faten Aggad, Executive Director-African Future Policies Hub (AFPH).\n\nIn addition to food security concerns, the report highlights broader economic strain the levy could place on African households. Countries like Ghana could see household incomes fall by 0.101 percent; a drop ten times greater than that forecast for European households under the same levy.\n\nThe economic imbalances exacerbated by this carbon tax will most likely deepen existing disparities between developed and developing nations, with African countries shouldering a disproportionate burden of the global transition to net-zero emissions.\n\nThe report also highlights structural imbalances in freight costs that are likely to worsen under the levy. African nations already face higher shipping costs due to smaller trade volumes, less developed infrastructure and weaker negotiating power in global shipping markets.\n\nA carbon levy without targetted compensation or adjustments for developing economies would, according to the report, only widen this gap.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, the report offers a series of recommendations for the IMO and global policymakers. Central among them is a call for the IMO to ensure a significant portion of revenues raised by the carbon levy is directed toward funding out-of-sector mitigation and resilience measures in line with the ‘polluter pays’ principle.\n\nThe report argues that revenue distribution should consider factors such as a country’s exposure to climate risks, economic context, fiscal space and contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe report’s authors emphasise that while decarbonising the shipping industry is inevitable, it must be done in a way which does not unfairly shift the burden onto vulnerable African nations. “Ensuring that the transition to a net-zero shipping sector does not come at the expense of African citizens is crucial.\n\nAfrican countries must engage with the issue, understanding both the risks and opportunities – particularly areas like investment in green hydrogen and maritime shipping fuels,” Aggad stated.\n\nThe report’s release is part of an ongoing effort to promote equitable climate action that balances the global need for decarbonisaation with economic realities of developing regions. It calls on African governments to actively participate in international negotiations, advocating for mechanisms that redistribute the financial burden of decarbonisation from vulnerable nations to major polluters.\n\nThe report was funded by the Climate Emergency Collaboration Group (CECG) and Ocean Conservancy and reflects collective efforts of APRI, Firoz Lalji Institute for Africa at LSE and AFPH.",

   "Content": "The federal government has been charged to put up mechanisms that will align current economic realities with the expected economic growth in order to meet its $1 trillion economy projection by the year 2030.\n\nThe Managing Director/Chief Economist, Analysts Data Services & Resources Limited, Dr. Afolabi Olowookere, stated this at the 9th Annual National Conference of the National Association of Insurance and Pension Editors held in Lagos.\n\nSpeaking on the theme, “Towards A $1trillion Economy, Roles of Insurance And Pension Sectors,” he urged federal government to tinker with the current policies and speed up infrastructure development to encourage more investments, to realise the $1 trillion economy projection.\n\nAccording to Olowookere, the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew from 2.98 per cent in the first quarter of the year to 3.19 per cent in the second quarter, noting that the forecasts in the short to medium term remained weak. \n\nSpeaking, the Chief Investment Officer of Access ARM Pensions, Wale Okunrinboye, has called on long-term and institutional investors to take a more active role in financing sectors critical to Nigeria’s industrialization and economic growth.\n\nHe highlighted the need for pension funds, insurance companies, and other key financial stakeholders to collaborate with the government to achieve Nigeria’s ambitious goal of becoming a $1 trillion economy.\n\nHe emphasised that countries transitioning from underdeveloped to developed economies typically undergo a robust phase of industrialization, followed by the growth of high-service sectors.\n\nOkunrinboye stressed that attracting both local and foreign investments is essential for Nigeria to become a fully industrialized economy. He urged pension funds and other long-term investors, traditionally focused on government securities, to diversify their portfolios into critical sectors that can drive industrialisation.\n\n“To transition into a fully industrial economy, we need to attract investments some of which should be local, and some foreign. This is where pension funds and other long-term investors come in. A large portion of pension fund investments is currently in government securities, but recent discussions have focused on the need to invest beyond government securities as a way to catalyze and develop the economy,” Okunrinboye said.\n\nEarlier in his goodwill message, the Chairman of the occasion, and a former Commissioner for Insurance, Mr Fola Daniel, commended NAIPE for putting the programme together.",

   "Content": "The Chief Financial Officer, Seplat Energy, Mrs. Eleanor Adaralegbe has argued that Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) standards and regulatory frameworks in African countries significantly shape oil and gas investments on the continent.\n\nAdarakegbe, who said this during a panel session at the Africa Oil Week (AOW) Conference & Exhibitions in Cape Town, South Africa, noted that these factors influence costs, compliance requirements, and project risk profiles.\n\nEleanor, while speaking on the theme ‘ESG Investing: What strategies make African deals attractive in 2024?’, said to ensure compliance and manage ESG-related risks effectively, companies should conduct thorough due diligence, align with international standards, engage with stakeholders, implement robust policies, and maintain transparent reporting.\n\n“Clearly, ESG standards and regulatory frameworks in African countries significantly shape oil and gas investments. So, we need to take the right actions now. These actions not only mitigate risks but also create opportunities for enhanced stakeholder trust, improved financing options, and long-term project success,” the Seplat Energy CFO stressed.\n\nAccording to her, investors assess potential projects by screening them against ESG benchmarks; of which projects that fail to meet minimum ESG standards are often excluded.\n\nShe said: “Comprehensive due diligence is conducted to identify ESG risks, including environmental impact, community relations, and governance practices. Investors may use frameworks like the Equator Principles or International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards. In this regard, Seplat Energy is ahead, proactively setting up to ensure readiness very much aligned with Strategy.\n\n“Seplat Energy has shown commitment, which is driven from the top- Board, special board committee on ESG matters, and Sustainability management committee chaired by the CEO.”\n\nEleanor advocated the need for operators in the energy space to building a sustainable business through social development, focusing on environmental care and reporting as well as maximising returns for shareholders.\n\nWith a mission to deliver the energy transition in Nigeria through upstream, midstream and new energy pillars, she identified the roles of strong governance and HSE, as is the case with Seplat Energy’s operations in Nigeria.\n\nInvestors, she explained, are increasingly pushing for energy transition projects, such as natural gas developments that serve as a bridge to renewable energy; with also a growing interest in carbon offset initiatives linked to oil and gas operations, which could help mitigate climate impacts.",

   "source": "This Day (Nigeria)",
   "Content": "Following the recent Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) increase to 26.25 per cent by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), 11 deposit money banks (DMBs) have announced massive increase in the cost of servicing customers’ current, savings, and term deposits.\n\nAnanlysis of the banks’ financial reports show a whooping 148 per cent to N3.27 trillion in half-year ((H1) ended June 30, 2024, as against N1.32 trillion reported in the corresponding period of 2023.\n\nThe banks include; United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA), Access Holdings Plc, Zenith Bank Plc, FBN Holdings Plc, and Ecobank. Others are: Fidelity Bank Plc, FCMB Group Plc, Wema Bank Plc, Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc, Wema Bank Plc, and Sterling Financial Holdings Company Plc.\n\nThe unprecedented increase has not only set the MPR at its highest level to date, but also reflects the CBN’s determination to address galloping inflation. Nigeria’s inflation recorded a year-on-year peak of 34.19 per cent in June 2024 (32.70 per cent September 2024).\n\nThe decision has garnered praise from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which commended the MPC’s resolve to tighten monetary policy further by increasing the policy rate to 26.25 per cent.\n\nAnalysis of results and accounts released on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), showed that FBN Holdings reported one of the highest increases in its interest expenses in the period under review, followed by Zenith Bank.\n\nWhile FBN Holding declared N432.76 billion in interest expenses in H1 2024, about a 219 per cent increase from N135.68billion in H1 2023, Zenith Bank posted N434.36billion interest expenses in H1 2024, representing an increase of 183 per cent from N153.56billion reported in H1 2023.\n\nEcobank, a Pan-African financial institution, announced N464.87 billion interest expenses in H1 2024, a growth of 160 per cent from N178.89 billion declared in H1 2023.\n\nAccess Holdings in the period announced N958.7billion interest expenses in H1 2024, about 151 per cent increase from N382.6billion while UBA reported N328.94billion interest expenses in H1 2024, an increase of 119 per cent from N150.18billion declared in H1 2023.\n\nGTCO’s interest expenses stood at N126.4 billion in H1 2024, a growth of 161 per cent from N48.5billion in H1 2023.\n\nCommenting, the management of GTCO stated that the key driver for the interest expense increase to N126.38billion in H1 2024 from N48.49 billion in H1 2023 was the 642 basis points and 780 basis points pick-up in the cost of savings account and time deposits on the back of adjustment to MPR to which interest paid on savings account is indexed.\n\n“The increase in interest rates impacted interest paid on savings accounts and time deposits, leading to an increase in the group’s cost of funds from 1.4 per cent in H1 2023 to 1.5 per cent in H1 2024,” GTCO added.\n\nOn its part, Fidelity Bank announced N146.83billion interest expenses in H1 2024, an increase of 79 per cent from N82.08billion in H1 2023; Stanbic IBTC Holdings posted N71.8 billion interest expenses in H1 2024, an increase of N37.58billion in H1 2023; Wema Bank announced N82.9billion interest expenses in H1 2024, representing an increase of 89 per cent from N43.8billion in H1 2023; FCMB Group’s interest expenses moved from N76.71 billion in H1 2023, up 112 per cent from N162.98billion in H1 2024 and Sterling Financial Holdings disclosed N63.29billion interest expenses in  H1 2024, up 100.3 per cent increase from N31.61billion reported in H1 2023.\n\nAccording to Stanbic IBTC, “Interest expense increased by over 91per cent to N71.8 billion in H1 2024 majorly due to growth in average term deposits and borrowings during the period under review. Cost of funds thereby rose to 4.3 per cent from 3.2per cent in H1 2023.”\n\nWith the raising of MPR, the average interest on customers’ savings deposits as of June 2024 stood at 6.67 per cent as against 5.18 per cent in June 2023, while the six-month deposit rate increased to 15.09 per cent as of June 2024 from  8.54 per cent in June 2023.\n\nHowever, the steep increase in the policy rate has sparked concerns regarding the potential impact on the cost of credit for businesses already facing economic hardships.\n\nThe DMBs in the period have benefitted significantly from MPR reflected on interest income in the period under review.\n\nEach bank offers different lending rates that reflect their respective approaches to lending to the key sectors in Nigeria, among other African countries where they operate.\n\nIn Nigeria, large corporations perceived as having lesser risk with a history of generating consistent cash flows are offered prime lending rates, while small businesses and individuals perceived as having higher risk typically fall above the prime lending rate margin.\n\nAnalysts have attributed the increase in lending to the hike in MPR and severe macroeconomy challenges.\n\n“The recent announcement, made by CBN Governor, Dr. Yemi Cardoso, had highlighted the central bank’s proactive approach towards monetary tightening amidst challenging economic conditions. The rate hike will slow economic growth and reduce consumer spending, according to analysts at FBN Quest.\n\n“Ultimately, the impact on the general economy could be a potential slowdown in economic growth, with consumer spending suppressed, and a decrease in business investments,” FBN Quest said in a recent note.",

   "Content": "A coalition of oil-producing African countries is seeking $5 billion to launch an “energy bank” that would fund projects on the continent, as frustration grows over the reluctance of western institutions to bankroll fossil fuel initiatives because of environmental concerns, FT has reported.\n\nThe 18-member African Petroleum Producers’ Organisation (APPO) hopes the lender can begin operating in early 2025, according to the Executive Vice President of global trade at the African Export-Import Bank, Haytham El Maayergi, a partner in the project.\n\nAfrica’s oil producers have encountered funding restrictions from traditional western backers, including multilateral institutions whose rules increasingly bar them from oil and gas investing.\n\nThe World Bank stopped financing upstream oil and gas projects in 2019 while the African Development Bank, which has the US as its number two shareholder, does not put money into fossil fuel projects.\n\nEl Maayergi, however, insisted that “Africa’s context is totally different from what you find elsewhere” because its resources had not been fully developed and it had made only a minimal contribution to climate change.\n\nEl Maayergi said there were other projects in Africa that were unconnected to fossil fuels, such as electricity infrastructure, that also needed funding.\n\nStandard Chartered last year pulled out of a billion-dollar deal to finance a pipeline to carry crude from landlocked Uganda to the Tanzanian coast after the proposed project became a target for environmental activists.\n\nCampaigners say such funding blocks serve to exacerbate energy poverty in Africa, a continent where 600mn people lack access to electricity and almost 1bn people still cook with dirty energy sources such as charcoal and firewood.\n\nThey argue that Africa should be allowed to exploit its oil and gas resources to kick-start industrialisation because it has hardly contributed to rising global carbon emissions.\n\nThe African Energy Chamber, an advocacy group, has argued that Africa has the “sovereign right” to develop its natural resources — which according to the group includes 125 billion barrels of oil and 620tn cubic feet of natural gas — in a “balanced and sustainable” manner.",

   "source": "The Star",
   "Content": "Electricity retailer Kenya Power now says investment by Adani Group in the country’s energy sector will improve distribution and help cut losses, despite coming at a cost.\n\nThe utility firm has backed the deal between Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (Ketraco) and Adani Energy Solutions, a subsidiary of Adani Group, which will see the Indian firm pump $736 million (Sh95.1 billion) into the construction and maintenance of a number of power lines and sub-stations in the country.\n\nAccording to Kenya Power chairperson Joy Brenda Masinde, the deal will help actualise projects that Ketraco could not deliver due to cash constraints.\n\nThis, she said, will significantly improve the country’s power distribution network, stabilising power supply that has been affected by ageing lines that lead to frequent outages. “An entrant like Adani for us is quite exciting because Ketraco being fully government and then the government being cash-strapped means there are parts of the lines that Keraco could not.\n\nNow that they have an investor who is cash-rich and has experience, hopefully during the next two-years the distribution network is more robust and easier for us to distribute power to consumers,” she said.\n\nMasinde spoke during a forum by Huawei dubbed “Accelerating industrial digitisation and intelligence” at the ongoing Gitex 2024 (Gulf Information Technology Exhibition), in Dubai.\n\nShe however acknowledged that the investment could come at an extra cost since the Indian fi rm has to recoup its monies.\n\n“Relief in terms of connectivity yes, in terms of pricing no, because with a private entrant there will be wheeling charges, they need to make a return on investment so there will be an additional component of a wheeling charge, but how the government works out on pricing that is up to EPRA,” she noted.\n\nA wheeling charge in electricity bill refers to the fees imposed by the utility company for the transportation of electricity through its transmission and distribution infrastructure.\n\nAdani Group will build and operate four key electricity transmission lines and two sub-stations for 30 years before handing over to the Kenyan government. The transmission lines and substations to be developed under the deal are 400kV (Double-Circuit) Gilgil-Thika-Malaa-Konza Line spanning 208.73 km.\n\nThe line will include new substations at Gilgil, Thika, and Malaa as well as substantial extensions at Konza. The deal will also see the development of a 220kV Rongai-Keringet-Chemosit Line covering 99.98 km.\n\nThe lines will come as a relief to the power distributor who has been on the receiving end as a result of back-to-back power outages blamed on its old lines, some dating back 102 years since electricity distribution lines commenced in the country.\n\n“I am pleased to announce the successful signing of the Project Agreement between the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company Limited (Ketraco) and Adani Energy Solutions Limited today (the Project Company). The agreement marks the beginning of a transformative initiative to develop, finance, construct, operate, and maintain key transmission lines and substations across Kenya, Energy CS Opiyo Wandayi said last week.\n\nThe project is one of the biggest Public-Private Partnership deal in the energy sector, as the government turns to the private sector for support in the wake of a strained exchequer in terms of development budget.",

   "Content": "MPs are proposing the formation of an Aviation Holding Company (AHC) to oversee the restructuring of Kenya’s aviation sector. In the plan, the company will manage Kenya Airways, Kenya Airports Authority, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and an Aviation Services College.\n\nIn a report to be tabled in parliament, the National Assembly Transport, Public Works and Housing Committee concluded that the current Project Implemented Investment Plan (PIIP) is not a feasible solution for reviving the sector.\n\nThe MPs are also proposing the nationalisation of Kenya Airways (KQ) in an effort to reposition Nairobi as a leading African aviation hub and secure the country’s aviation assets.\n\nCommittee chair David Pkosing who is the Pokot South MP, expressed concern over the financial state of KQ, noting that the national carrier’s mounting debt—currently guaranteed by the government to the tune of Sh75 billion—poses a significant risk to the country.\n\n“The Committee noted that taking into account KQ’s current financial status and the current lack of competitiveness of Kenya’s aviation industry, the Government and the people of Kenya stand to lose the most in the event the trend is left to continue,” said Pkosing in the report.\n\nThe proposed AHC would consist of the four subsidiaries, where JKIA Company will manage the Nairobi-based international hub, including ground handling and catering services.\n\nKenya Airports Authority (KAA) will oversee other airports and airstrips, with a mandate to maintain at least one serviceable airstrip per county for security and emergency purposes, while Kenya Airways (KQ) will be the national flag carrier and Aviation Services College/Institute: to centralize aviation training.\n\n“Under its new mandate KAA shall maintain at least one serviceable airstrip in each county for purposes of security, health and other emergencies,” recommended the committee.\n\nTo streamline operations and reduce bureaucracy, the committee called for the nationalisation of KQ to be accompanied by amendments to key legislation, including the Public Finance Management Act, the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, and the State Corporations Act.\n\nThese changes would allow the new AHC and its subsidiaries to operate with greater financial autonomy and flexibility.\n\nThe committee also recommended a series of tax concessions and exemptions for the AHC, including zero-rating of supplies, customs duty exemptions for aircraft parts and accessories, and waivers on excise duties for aviation fuel, among other incentives.\n\nThis aimed at improving the financial sustainability of the AHC and KQ, allowing them to compete more eff ectively within the region. The report further suggested a review of KQ’s aircraft leasing agreements to renegotiate favourable terms.\n\n“Upon nationalisation of KQ, the government reviews the aircraft leasing agreements entered into by KQ with a view to renegotiating better terms on account of the consolidated balance sheet of the Aviation Holding Company, improved KQ cash flow and a lowered risk profile of Kenyan aviation assets.\n\nAny future leasing arrangements for aircraft must be cost-effective,” the report reads in part. The MPs are also recommending for the rationalisation of KQ’s staff and a review of collective bargaining agreements were also proposed to harmonize employment conditions across the new aviation structure.\n\n“Upon nationalisation of KQ, the state undertakes a staff rationalisation programme with a view of retaining existing staff and harmonizing the terms of service and remuneration under the Aviation Holding Company, including a review of the Collective Bargaining Agreements.”",

   "source": "BusinessDay",
   "Content": "Bread prices have risen very fast in Nigeria in recent times at a point when elevated inflation levels are eroding citizens’ incomes.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the headline inflation increased to 32.70 percent in September 2024 from 32.15 percent in August 2024.\n\nIt said on Tuesday that the month-on-month inflation rate for September 2024 went up 0.30 percent to 2.52 percent in September.\n\nThe major driver of the headline inflation was the petrol price increases, which affected the general price level in the economy.\n\nIn September, Nigerians experienced an upward review of petrol prices from N597.00 to N855.00.\n\nLast week, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) increased petrol prices from N950/litre to N998/litre in Lagos and as high as N1,003 in northeastern states, the second increment in two months as petrol price deregulation took full effect.\n\nBread out of breakfast table\n\nBread prices have increased across the board in the last six to 12 months. A loaf of bread which was sold for N1,000 at grocery shops four months ago now sells between N1,300 and N1,500.\n\nA loaf of bread which was sold at N400 in October 2023 now goes for N800 in various parts of Lagos and Abuja.\n\nAccording to Jude Okafor, national secretary of the Association Master Bakers and Caterers of Nigeria (AMBCN), “Prices of every ingredient for bread has doubled from year to date and the situation is hopeless for the industry.”\n\nHe said the government is yet to address the challenges of the industry and lacks the will to urge millers to use substitutes such as cassava and potatoes in their flour production.\n\nBusinessDay found that a 50 kg of flour, an input for making bread, now sells for N62, 500 as against N39,750 sold in February 2024, indicating a 57.2 percent surge in price.\n\nA 50kg bag of sugar, another input, now sells for N88,000 as against N68,500 in February 2024, indicating a 28.5 percent rise in price.\n\nAlso, a carton of yeast comprising 20 sachets, now sells for N70, 000 as against N22,000 sold December 2023. A 15kg of butter now sells for N42,000 as against N18,000 in 2023. Also, a 25kg of vegetable oil has also surged to N60,000 from N N40,000 in December 2023.\n\nAnalysts’ views on inflation\n\nNigeria’s inflation rate in September showed only a modest increase, surprising analysts despite the steep rise in petrol prices, according to Razia Khan, managing director and chief economist for Africa and the Middle East at Standard Chartered Bank.\n\nKhan revealed that month-on-month inflation rose by 2.5 percent, up from 2.2 percent in August, even after petrol prices jumped by approximately 45 percent during the month. “Nigeria’s September inflation rose much more modestly than we expected—only 2.5 percent m/m despite the about 45 percent increase in petrol prices,” she said, noting that the increase was lower than anticipated.\n\nShe attributed the subdued inflation to several factors, including tight monetary policy and sluggish income growth, which kept the year-on-year inflation rate at 32.7 percent.\n\n“This likely reflects already-tight policy and squeezed income growth, limiting the y/y rise to 32.7 percent,” Khan explained.\n\nWhile food price inflation remained a concern, particularly in light of recent flooding that disrupted agriculture, Khan pointed to some positive indicators in the latest data. “Although food price inflation is still considerable—with food products up 2.6 percent m/m and imported food 3.6 percent m/m—we think this print bodes well for the outlook for inflation overall, signaling little spillover from the hike in PMS prices,” she remarked.\n\nLooking ahead, Khan projected that October would likely experience an even more modest month-on-month inflation increase. Although it is possible that the full impact of the subsidy removal may be delayed, she emphasised that other economic developments, including tighter policy measures and greater stability in the foreign exchange market, would likely curb inflationary pressures.\n\n“We are more inclined to think that the further tightening of policy at the end of September—with a 500-basis-point hike in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)—and FX stabilisation of sorts thereafter, will be overriding,” Khan said.\n\nDespite lingering risks, Khan added that the latest inflation data offers some relief, as the likelihood of a sharp surge in inflation appears low.\n\nMuda Yusuf, CEO of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), said: “It is troubling that we are witnessing a resurgence of high inflationary pressures after some few months of respite despite policy measures to tame inflation, especially on the monetary side,” Yusuf said.\n\n“Purchasing power has continued to plunge over the past few months. The situation had been further exacerbated by the surging petrol price.”\n\n“The reality is that the dynamics driving inflation are yet to be effectively subdued,” he explained, identifying key drivers such as the depreciating exchange rate, rising fuel and transportation costs, supply chain disruptions, high energy prices, and climate-related events like flooding. “These are largely supply-side issues,” Yusuf added. He also pointed to seasonal agricultural output, which often triggers short-term price hikes for certain food crops.\n\nYusuf warned that inflationary pressures are raising production costs, undermining profitability and weakening investor confidence.\n\nHe called for urgent government intervention to address the production, productivity, and security challenges facing the economy.",

   "Content": "Commercial banks are upgrading their technology infrastructures to avoid a repeat of the transfer failures that bugged Nigerians during a now-withdrawn Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s cashless policy.\n\nHowever, many customers are currently bearing the brunt of short-term frustrations in exchange for long-term benefits.\n\n“The upgrades will improve banking capacity and cope with increased online banking demand,” said Adedeji Olowe, founder and chief executive officer of Lendsqr, who once worked at UBA, Access Bank, Fidelity, and FCMB.\n\nNigeria’s electronic payments rose by 84.37 percent to N572.63 trillion in the first seven months of 2024, highlighting the country’s growing reliance on digital payments and shift away from cash dependence. Following a CBN withdrawal policy, cashless payments increased to N611.06 trillion from N395.38 trillion in 2022.\n\nHowever, this rapid rise in cashless transactions has exposed gaps in the country’s banking infrastructure. “The lack of adequate digital and financial infrastructure and processes to support a swift transition to a cashless economy… further exacerbated the situation,” the World Bank commented about Nigeria’s cashless transition in 2023.\n\nWhy the upgrade causes disruptions\n\nAccording to Femi Adeoti, group managing director of RoutePay, the current banking and digital payment infrastructure is inadequate to cater to the expected growth in the volume of digital/electronic-based transactions.\n\n“While we are right to celebrate an increase as significant as 125 percent, the failures recorded show that we could have achieved more,” he stated in an interview.\n\nThese infrastructure upgrades are also critical to strengthening banks’ cybersecurity capabilities. Between 2019 and 2023, Nigerian bank customers lost N59.33 billion to fraud, with over 80,658 customers scammed in 2023 alone—a slight decrease from 84,130 in 2022.\n\nBanks are ramping up investments in their core banking infrastructure to close these gaps, especially as the country aims to become cashless by 2025. Five banks intend to invest N248.21 billion in technology upgrades over the coming months.\n\n“A core part of the GTCOPLC Group’s customer experience strategy is strengthening its digital platform to support the delivery of a consistent and seamless banking experience for customers… the GTCOPLC Group invests resources for reducing the number of failures and minimising the potential damage to the businesses of the Operating Entities,” stated Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) in its recapitalisation offer prospectus.\n\nGTB also revealed that upgrading its core banking applications, hardware, and network architecture would cost N70 billion. Despite the upgrades being in customers’ interests, industry experts say banks have not been transparent about the timelines for their IT migrations.\n\nFor example, Zenith Bank’s migration of its core banking platform from Phoenix to Flexcube took longer than the 24-hour timeline it provided. Similarly, Sterling Bank’s migration to SEABaaS, a custom-built core banking platform, also faced delays. Currently, GTB customers are experiencing disruptions despite the bank announcing the completion of its migration to the Finacle core banking system.\n\n“GTB’s entire system is still down. We can’t make online payments yet,” a customer told BusinessDay.\n\n“Migrating to a new core banking system is complex,” said a fintech CEO.\n\n“It involves infrastructure, software, customer channels, historical data, training, certification, and commissioning.”\n\nHowever, a senior executive close to Finacle said, “Replacing a core banking application is like changing the engine of a Boeing 747 mid-flight.”\n\nIn the 2000s, First Bank took six months to migrate from Bankmaster to Finacle. A tier-one bank worker echoed, “Migrations take a lot of time. Our last major upgrade took a while as well.”\n\nAccording to Adedeji Okowe, founder of Lendsqr, “These upgrades are routine for banks globally. Large businesses must periodically upgrade their core systems.”\n\nThese improvements are essential as the banking sector gears up for growth amidst capital raises. In March, the CBN announced new capital requirements, mandating international banks to increase their capital base to N500 billion, national banks to N200 billion, and regional banks to N50 billion.\n\nIn 2005, banks were mandated to increase their capital base to N25 billion. This led to many mergers and technology upgrades. For example, the merger between United Bank for Africa, Standard Trust Bank, and Continental Trust Bank into the UBA group led UBA to change its banking software to Finacle from Flexcube.\n\n“Banks are preparing for the future,” Olowe added. “With new capital, they are ready for hyper-scale growth, supported by better platforms.”\n\nHowever, some industry experts suggest it is suspect that many banks are upgrading their IT infrastructures around the same time. “It is unusual for banks to upgrade their software simultaneously. They would term this a coordinated market action if this were the US,” one analyst said.",

   "Content": "The Nigerian government needs to significantly increase investment in the agricultural sector to effectively tackle hunger, especially in the face of worsening climate change and the impact of conflict and socio-economic challenges, stakeholders said on Wednesday.\n\nThey made this recommendation at a plenary session on ‘tackling hunger’ at the 30th Nigeria Economic Summit in Abuja.\n\nAssalama Sidi, regional director for West and Central Africa at Oxfam International, expressed concerns that Nigeria’s budgetary commitment is insufficient to drive the desired growth in this critical sector.\n\nShe urged the government to fulfil its obligations under the Malabo Agreement, which mandates African nations to allocate at least 10 percent of their budgets to agriculture.\n\n“Almost 11 years later, we’re still spending around three percent in this important sector that employs most of the young people and women in Africa.\n\nOne thing I would expect from the government of Nigeria is to see an increase in the budget for the agriculture sector,” she said.\n\nSidi emphasised the importance of enhanced financing to promote mechanisation among small-scale farmers, advocating for government subsidies to help them acquire necessary machinery.\n\n“If not, we’ll be creating another inequality issue where the wealthy would be getting all the mechanised tools while small-scale farmers are left behind,” she warned.\n\nShe also highlighted the detrimental impact of climate change on food production, noting that rising temperatures—1.5 times faster in West Africa—leading to increased flooding, droughts, and ultimately reduced agricultural yields.\n\n“Temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster in West Africa, creating flooding, droughts, or less rain fall. Of course, that’s leading to a concerning decrease in agricultural yield in Nigeria. For instance, last year, we lost about £2.12 billion, which is about 50 percent of its agricultural production.”\n\nShe pointed out that this decline in production is contributing to soaring food inflation, which reached 40 percent in March 2024, with the agricultural sector, which used to employ 70 percent of the workforce, now declining due to climate change issues.\n\nThe regional director urged the government to take concrete actions to address the challenges facing the agricultural sector, reviewing policies in favour of small-scale farmers and women, who constitute the majority of agriculturists in Africa.\n\nDavid Stevenson, country director of the World Food Programme, highlighted the potential for meaningful collaboration between the public and private sectors to enhance funding for agriculture and related interventions.\n\nHe urged the government to ensure farmers return to their farms and receive seeds and fertilisers at the right time.\n\nBoye Olusanya, CEO of Flour Mills Nigeria PLC, stressed that increasing agricultural yields is crucial for driving industrialisation in Nigeria, stating that the country has a yield problem.\n\n“Let’s double yield to increase food production and de-risk funding for smallholder farmers to guarantee output,” he urged.\n\nOlusanya further underscored the importance of creating a comprehensive database of farmers to facilitate targeted funding. “If we get that right, there will be a significant improvement that smallholder farmers will see,” he stressed.\n\nHe recommended that the government develop a data system to provide early warnings and indicators on where private sector intervention is most needed.\n\nAdditionally, he called for government support in establishing strategic reserves and storage solutions to ensure price stability for agricultural products.",

   "source": "BusinessDay",
   "Content": "The Nigerian naira is too weak to claim the best performing currency title in Sub-Saharan Africa as Kenyan shilling leads. The east African country’s currency gained 21 percent year-to-date by end-August 2024, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe multilateral lender in its latest Africa’s Pulse report disclosed that tighter financial conditions and a strong dollar as well as foreign exchange market reforms resulted in the weakening of most currencies in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2023.\n\nIt noted that the Angolan kwanza, Malawian kwacha, Nigerian naira, South Sudanese pound, and Zambian kwacha were the worst performing currencies in the region in 2023.\n\nHowever, while some currencies have remained weakened due to foreign exchange shortages, others like the Kenyan shilling and South African rand have begun to strengthen.\n\n“The Kenyan shilling is the best performing currency in Sub-Saharan Africa this year: it appreciated by 21 percent year-to-date by end-August 2024,” the World Bank said.\n\n“The South African rand and currencies pegged to it have strengthened by 3.1 percent so far this year, after losing value in the past year,” it added.\n\nMeanwhile, by end of August 2024, the Ethiopian birr, Nigerian naira, and South Sudanese pound were still among the worst performers in the region, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe Washington-based bank however warned that despite the fact that most currencies are stabilizing, exchange rate pressures and shortages of foreign exchange remain a concern for African policy makers\n\nNaira plunges to 1,658.97/$ on Tuesday\n\nThe naira, on Tuesday depreciated by 6.4 percent as the dollar quoted at N1,658.97 compared to N1,552.92 on Monday at the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market (NAFEM), according to data obtained from the FMDQ Securities Exchange Limited.\n\nIt reported a loss of N106.05 as the official foreign exchange (FX) market turnover declined by 36.62 percent at the close of trading on Tuesday.\n\nThe Nigerian naira continued losing value, with a year-to-date depreciation of about 43 percent as of end-August, according to the World Bank.\n\n“Surges in demand for US dollars in the parallel market, driven by financial institutions, money managers, and nonfinancial end-users, combined with limited dollar inflows and slow foreign exchange disbursements to currency exchange bureaus by the central bank explain the weakening of the naira,” the Washington-based bank added.\n\nThe Nigerian naira’s depreciation began following the unification of the exchange rate and subsequently allowed the local unit to be determined by market forces last June.\n\nThe liberalisation of the foreign exchange segment, aimed to draw in more capital inflows badly needed to kickstart the economy, has seen the naira lose about 70 percent of its value.\n\n“More broadly, the weakening of most African currencies resulted from foreign exchange shortages as export proceeds were subdued and international debt payments increased,” the Africa’s Pulse report stated.\n\nNigeria’s naira is at its cheapest in decades\n\nNigeria’s currency is the cheapest that it has been in decades, thanks to painful but needed economic reforms to put the nation on a long-term path to recovery.\n\n“The naira’s real exchange rate is at its most competitive in at least 20 years,” said World Bank’s Chief Economist Indermit Gill. “This is a great opportunity for the private sector,” he told the Nigerian Economic Summit Group on Monday in the capital, Abuja.",

   "Url": "https://businessday.ng/politics/article/utomi-faults-tinubus-approach-to-fuel-subsidy-removal/",
   "source": "BusinessDay",
   "Content": "Pat Utomi, a professor of political economy, has said the approach adopted by President Bola Tinubu’s administration in the removal of fuel subsidy in Nigeria was wrong because it does not focus on subsidising production and would ultimately compound the suffering of Nigerians.\n\nUtomi stated that he was in support of removal of fuel subsidy, because the scheme benefited few Nigerians, but stressed that President Tinubu got it wrong by not putting in place a mechanism to subsidize fuel to aid production.\n\nUtomi stated this in an interview recently, noting that the current subsidy policy would not yield the desired impact.\n\n“If you are going to remove subsidies as we have all over the world, focus on subsidizing production. How can you use access to that price of fuel to stimulate people producing?\n\n“But subsidy policy does not support production and so if you just say we are removing subsidy without putting thought to its impact then you are going to compound the matter”, Utomi said\n\nAnswering questions on the state of the nation, Utomi noted there was nothing cheering about the current administration, while policies are not well thought- through before implementation.\n\nSpeaking further, he said the country’s political system is now a complete criminal enterprise, with most Nigerians losing faith in the country’s electoral system, while major institutions, such as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are captured.\n\nAccording to him, “The Nigerian political system is now a complete criminal enterprise. People don’t have any faith in the electoral process. The judiciary is captured. Institutions like the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), police and military are captured.\n\n“So it feels like Nigerians are in slavery and the only option is either violent revolt or somehow do what they did in Sri Lanka or Bangladesh. Unless the political class can wake up, look at their country and trace back their steps, we are in a finished state”.\n\nHe further accused President Tinubu of showing less concern about the dire situation Nigerians are facing.\n\nUtomi revealed that he went to President Tinubu in 2019, at the time Muhammadu Buhari was the President of Nigeria and complained to him about the dangerous path the leadership was taking at that time and its implications for the country and its citizens.\n\nHe disclosed that rather than speak up for the people, Tinubu chose to remain silent through Buhari’s eight years in power.\n\nHe made the submission while responding to a question during the interview bordering on how supporters of President Tinubu have said he is less than two years in office and that he did not cause all the problems Nigerians are ascribing to him.\n\nReacting, Utomi who spoke to Vanguard, said he couldn’t absolve anybody of blame because they all saw it coming but took no action, adding that the policies introduced by the current government have compounded the problems created by the previous leaders.\n\n“I’m not into who caused or did not cause. I can say publicly that part of my departure from Asiwaju Bola Tinubu was that I went to him in 2019 and told him that President Buhari was leading us to a dangerous place and that we should speak up, we should act as his so-called party members, but he was more strategic than concerned about Nigerians.\n\n“He kept quiet through Buhari’s starving eight years. So, I cannot absolve anybody, they all saw it coming and compounded it, and the policies that they were taking so abrasively, and unthinkingly have compounded the problem,” the Professor said.",

   "Url": "https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2024/10/18/world-bank-to-fg-conduct-audit-to-reconcile-what-nnpc-owes-federation/",
   "source": "This Day (Nigeria)",
   "Content": "The World Bank yesterday urged the federal government to carry out an audit to reconcile what the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) is owing the Federation as part of overall measures to sustain and deepen the current economic reforms.\n\n\nIt also called for improved reporting of oil revenues to the Federation Account Allocation Committee ((FAAC) as well as the maintenance of a market-reflective price on Premium Motor Spirit (PMS).\n\n\n\nThese were contained in the latest Nigeria Development Update (NDU) report, which was launched by the World Bank in Abuja.\n\n\nIn the report titled: “Staying the Course: Progress Amid Pressing Challenges,” the bank also urged the federal government to ensure that the gains from the removal of  PMS subsidy were flowing to the Federation as well as reform the Value Added Tax (VAT) regime and rationalise tax expenditures.\n\n\nThe bank equally urged the federal government to ensure that all FX-related transactions occur at the market determined exchange rate, cut wasteful expenditures that are not essential, including purchase of vehicles, and external training, among others.\n\n\nAt the NDU launch, the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Mr. Wale Edun also confirmed that PMS is now fully deregulated after 40 years of a tumultuous subsidy regime.\n\n\n\nAlso, the Governor of Bauchi State, Senator Bala Mohammed lamented that the economic reforms introduced by the federal removal which led to the removal of subsidy on PMS and the floating of the exchange rate of the naira had unleashed untold hardship on the people and needed to be revisited.\n\n\nAccording to the NDU report, since May 2023, Nigeria implemented significant reforms to stabilise its economy, resulting in modest growth, improved fiscal health, and rising foreign exchange reserves.\n\n\nHowever, it observed  that while these measures were necessary to urgently avert a fiscal crisis and place Nigeria on a stronger development path, they have imposed short-term pressures on households and businesses.\n\n\nThe report underscored the need to sustain these policies while addressing structural issues to combat inflation and promote long-term investment, growth, and job creation.\n\n\n\nWhile it is still early, the report stated that positive results from these reforms were beginning to show at the macroeconomic level, citing output growth which has remained modest overall, but inched higher through mid-2024 as oil sector output has stabilized and activity in some services has been robust.\n\n\nIt  noted that the fiscal position is also improving, with the federal government’s fiscal deficit narrowing to 4.4 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first half of 2024 from 6.2 per cent in the first half of 2023, helping to mitigate debt-related risks.\n\n\n “Foreign exchange reserves – a buffer against external shocks – have risen from $32.9 billion at the end of 2023 to more than $38.8 billion by mid-October 2024.\n\n\n“However, inflation remains high, and inched up again in September 2024, mainly due to the most recent gasoline price increases and recent floods,” the report said.\n\n\n\nGiven what it described as the promising results, the report argued that the new direction of macroeconomic policies should be sustained, including the Central Bank of Nigeria’s appropriately tight monetary policy stance.\n\n\nThe report stated that complementing them with measures to address long-standing structural constraints will enable faster progress in the fight against inflation, and spur the investment, growth, and jobs which Nigeria urgently needs.\n\n\nIt explained that previous distortionary and unsustainable policies were hindering Nigeria from achieving its immense potential, adding that a series of macroeconomic policy missteps between 2015 and 2023 contributed to an inflation surge in Nigeria\n\n\nIn his address at the launch, the World Bank Country Director in Nigeria,  Dr.  Ndiame Diop noted: “Nigeria took the bold and courageous move to undertake difficult but critical reforms. This against the backdrop of an already fragile economic position, high food and transport inflation, and other heightened uncertainties.\n\n\n\n“If these reforms were not done, Nigeria would have fallen into a serious fiscal crisis that would have made it difficult for government to meet its obligations to citizens.\n\n\n“Going forward, it will be important to consolidate the improving fiscal outlook and scale up the support for the poorest households to cope with purchasing power losses and hardships, while expanding opportunities for growth and productive jobs, especially for young Nigerians is most urgent and crucial.”\n\n\nDiop urged Nigerians to support the current economic reforms, adding that reversing them could pose serious negative consequences for the country.\n\n\nThe NDU report offered key recommendations on policy priorities to build upon Nigeria’s macro-critical reforms, and ignite growth and job creation.\n\n\n\nIt called for the maintenance of  a tight monetary policy until a sustained disinflation path is achieved and continue improving policy effectiveness.\n\n\nIt also urged monetary authorities to ensure the exchange rate is unified and reflects market conditions, while expanding the foreign exchange market.\n\n\nTo reduce debt risks and create room for development and poverty-focused spending, it advised that there should be focus on four key areas.\n\n\nThese, it  said, include continued removal of the fuel subsidy and increasing transparency in the oil sector, increase non-oil revenues through better tax policies, cutting government waste and direct spending to targeted poverty programmes, and stick to realistic budgets to avoid unplanned spending.\n\n\n\nThe report also recommended that the government should protect vulnerable groups by expanding cash transfer programs and strengthening social safety nets, as well as continue addressing long-standing structural constraints.\n\n\nWhile presenting the report, the Lead Economist of the World Bank for Nigeria,  Alex Sienaert said: “Recent reforms are starting to restore macroeconomic stability. GDP is projected to grow by 3.3 per cent in 2024, rising to an annual average of 3.7 per cent over 2025-2027; headline inflation is anticipated to peak at an average annual rate of 31.7 per cent in 2024, largely driven by the previous depreciation of the naira and increased gasoline prices.\n\n\n“Yet, in the medium term, staying the course with implementation of the current policy mix will reduce inflation, expected to fall to 14.3 by 2027 in the base case,” he said.\n\n\nHe, however, warned that 12 million more Nigerians risk slipping into poverty due to the current reforms, and the attendant job losses.\n\n\nSienaert noted that the N70,000 Minimum Wage increase was only for about 4 per cent of public sector workers, adding that only rewarding jobs can actually pull people out of poverty.\n\n\nDuring a panel discussion, the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Edun confirmed that subsidy on PMS had been finally “extinguished” with the full deregulation to pave the way for “market pricing.”\n\n\nEdun who had consistently been reluctant to admit in the past as to whether or not subsidy was fully removed,  said the subsidy regime cost Nigeria about 5 per cent of its gross domestic product GDP.\n\n\n“For the first time in 40 years, the vexed issue of fuel subsidy and linked to it, the foreign exchange subsidy, costing 5 per cent of GDP, have gone. It takes time to do reform. So what started on May 29, 2023, taken from one place, tried to re-exit in another place, and it was finally extinguished.\n\n\n“We have market pricing of PMS and with that, there’s huge benefit not only to NNPC, which was bearing the brunt, but to the economy as a whole, including the state governments and the local governments.\n\n\n“In the same regard, market pricing of foreign exchange. And it’s a difficult step, apart from all the other things that you do to ameliorate the pain generally of macroeconomic reform.\n\n\n“In this case, we sat down with the unions yesterday. We explained the economic trajectory the country was on, and we explained the opportunity which we all needed to ensure that we do not miss,” he said during a panel discussion, ” he said.\n\n\nAlso in response to a question, the Bauchi State Govenor,  Mohammed said the economic reforms were not working but inflicting pain on the people, calling for a revisit.\n\n\nMohammed who lamented the negative impact of the reforms on the masses, called for a reversal, adding that the governors risked being lynched by the people\n\n\nHe said: “I listened with rapt attention to the presentation of the World Bank, and I think the World Bank is very, very generous; very diplomatic as it is on the issue.\n\n\n“Coming from the sub-national, I know we are part of the Federation, and macroeconomic policies are normally under the auspices or the purview of the federal government.\n\n\n“We don’t determine policies. We are just players and partners in governance. But certainly, it is good, and I appreciate that I’m invited here so that you will know the other side of the story.\n\n\n“Yes, when the reform was started, the sub-nationals supported the president and the presidency, because we knew that we had to do something. And there were two things, subsidy removal and deregulation which would bring more revenues, which would make us move away from the obnoxious policy of patronage, of arbitrariness and so on and so forth.\n\n\n“Governor Cardoso (CBN governor) has spoken about the orthodox system. Yes, we can go through the orthodox system to achieve economic growth. Are we achieving them? Yes, he spoke about inflation. That means the macroeconomic policies that are creating inflation should be looked into.\n“I want to say with humility that there is a lot of pain, a lot of hardship that is beyond the sub-nationals.\n\n\n“We didn’t bring these policies, the revenues that are coming are not enough to address the cost of infrastructure, to develop or improve livelihood. There is hunger, and the policies on agriculture, on manufacturing and so on and so forth are not yielding the required fruits.\n\n\n“And I believe we should not be dogmatic and stand on the files of policy and academics. I find the report too academic. We should go back to the basics.\n“Nigerians are not enjoying the regime  across the board, not only the federal government, including the states and local governments.\n\n\n“Therefore, the onus rests on you,  Minister of Finance, and the managers of the economy  come up with a budget programme, with economic policies that will reduce hardship.”\n\n\nIn response to a question what the states were doing with increased FAAC allocations since the removal of subsidy  Mohammed said the money was not enough for recurrent expenditure and provide infrastructure at the same time.\n\n\n“The money that we are sharing is not enough. How much were we getting before? We spoke about the past, and the use of Ways and Means. Yes, it’s good to exit from that policy. But then what are you doing to make sure there is less hunger.\n\n\n“The report (NDU) spoke about employment and wages, how many percentage of Nigerians are even employed? Most of our people live in the informal sector. We should look at how we can make them employed. The purchasing power has dwindled beyond your imagination.\n\n\n” Yes, we need the reform. One of the lead economists said that there is this perception of compromise or conspiracy, yes, that is it. But you have to do your job. I agree with you, with all the numbers, and all the data you doled out.\n\n\n“These policies are not working, review them, and let us have food on the table. I know you have the capacity and the knowledge; we look up to you. States are loyal. We’ll follow you, but please, let us not go into blackmail, where we seem to be collecting money and doing nothing.\n\n\n“Yes, we will implement the minimum wage, which you agreed. But what is the volume of revenue we are getting? Can we do it, and if we do it, do we have anything left for infrastructure?\n\n\n“What about power, the tariff is beyond the reach of the common man. We are living with these people. We are at the risk of being lynched. Let us not stay in Abuja and say how the reforms are working. With all humility and modesty, they’re not.”\n\n\nMohammed’s position on Nigeria’s economic reforms not working was however,  countered by the Chief Economist of the World Bank,  Indermit Gill, who said despite the negative impacts, the reforms would launch Nigeria into economic prosperity and stability in the long run.",

   "source": "This Day (Nigeria)",
   "Content": "Credit to the Nigerian government surged to an unprecedented N31.15 trillion in August 2024, highlighting the government’s increasing reliance on domestic borrowing to meet its financial obligations.\n\nThis sharp rise, representing a whooping N11 trillion increase from N19.83 trillion in July 2024, reflects the growing attractiveness of government securities in a high-interest-rate environment.\n\nData released by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), underscores the government’s expanded borrowing strategy as it navigates fiscal pressures and limited revenue options.\n\nThe CBN’s latest money and credit statistics indicate a persistent upward trend in government borrowing throughout the year, driven largely by fiscal demands.\n\nFrom August 2023, when government credit stood at N22.51 trillion, borrowing has seen significant fluctuations. While there was a moderate rise to N23.52 trillion in January 2024, a sharp surge occurred in February when credit reached N33.93 trillion, marking the highest spike during the year. However, borrowing patterns displayed volatility, with a notable dip to N19.59 trillion in March, followed by a modest rise in April to N19.98 trillion.\n\nFollowing months, government credit resumed its upward trajectory, with May recording N28.38 trillion. Borrowing remained relatively stable over the next few months, hovering around N19.83 trillion in July before witnessing another substantial increase in August to N31.15 trillion.\n\nThe surge in government credit, analysts said, emphasises the government’s reliance on domestic credit markets as a primary funding source.\n\n“The rise in government borrowing coincides with a broader economic environment where rising interest rates have made government securities increasingly attractive to investors seeking safer, higher-yielding assets.\n\n“With inflationary pressures continuing to mount and borrowing costs rising, local investors have shown a strong appetite for government bonds, which offer relatively stable returns compared to other investment options, “analysts stated.",

   "source": "The High Street Journal",
   "Content": "The 2024 Annualized Percentage Rates (APR) report by the Bank of Ghana (BoG) reveals significant disparities in SME loan interest rates across financial institutions.\n\nAccording to the report, Stanbic Bank offers the highest APR for SME loans at 44.24%, while GCB Bank provides the most affordable rate at 29.58%.\n\nStanbic Bank’s 44.24% APR makes it the most expensive choice for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) seeking financing. This high rate reflects credit risk, administrative costs, and operational overhead. In contrast, GCB Bank’s rate of 29.58% offers a more affordable alternative for businesses requiring financial support.\n\nOther banks with high SME loan rates include Fidelity Bank at 41.60% and Consolidated Bank Ghana at 39.30%. Meanwhile, Access Bank and Universal Merchant Bank (UMB) offer more competitive APRs of 30.74% and 31.18%, respectively, alongside GCB Bank.\n\nThe Bank of Ghana’s APR report aims to enhance transparency in loan pricing, helping businesses make better financial decisions. By publishing these rates, the central bank encourages competition among lenders, potentially driving down borrowing costs across the sector.\n\nHowever, the wide range in APRs — from 29.58% to 44.24% — highlights the challenges SMEs face in securing affordable credit. Loan pricing is influenced by each bank’s risk assessments, operational costs, and strategies for SME lending.\n\nFor SMEs, the choice of lender can significantly impact financial sustainability. For example, a business opting for a loan at Stanbic Bank’s 44.24% rate would incur far higher borrowing costs than one taking a loan at GCB Bank’s 29.58% rate.\n\nAccess to affordable financing is crucial for SMEs, which play a vital role in Ghana’s economic growth by generating employment and driving development. However, high interest rates remain a major barrier to their expansion and profitability.\n\nThe report underscores the need for careful financial planning by SMEs. Business owners must compare loan options and select lenders that align with their operational goals and financial capacity.\n\nWith high interest rates posing challenges for SME growth, there may be calls for government intervention through subsidies, credit guarantees, or other schemes to improve access to affordable financing.\n\nAs the SME sector continues to drive economic development, securing cost-effective credit will remain essential for fostering business growth and sustainability in Ghana.",

   "source": "The High Street Journal",
   "Content": "Some forex bureaux in Accra have increased the selling rate of the US dollar to GH¢16.78, driven by surging demand, leading to further depreciation of the Ghanaian cedi. Previously, the dollar was sold at GH¢16.50 at some key bureaux but by the end of Monday, October 14, it reached GH¢16.78, raising concerns about worsening cedi depreciation and potential price hikes during the holiday season.\n\nThis trend aligns with movements in the interbank market, where the dollar traded between GH¢16.03 and GH¢16.10 on Monday, surpassing the GH¢16 mark. As a result, the price of goods, including petroleum products, is expected to rise. The LPG Marketers Association has already warned of a potential 6% increase in LPG prices starting tomorrow due to both global petroleum price hikes and the cedi’s depreciation.\n\nIf not addressed, the cedi’s continued decline could lead to higher prices for imported items and an increase in inflation, undermining economic gains achieved earlier in the year. Analysts are calling on the Bank of Ghana to intervene by releasing more US dollars into the market to stabilize the cedi.\n\nThe country’s Gross International Reserve improved from 2.9 months of import cover in May to 3.4 months in August, giving the Bank of Ghana room to inject dollars into the system. In addition to imports for the festive season, there is suspicion that some individuals may be buying US dollars as a store of value, anticipating further cedi depreciation, which has been a recurring issue in the first quarter of the year.\n\nMeanwhile the Ghana cedi and three other currencies have been ranked among the worst-performing in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in 2024, according to the World Bank’s October 2024 Africa Pulse Report.\n\nThe report revealed that the cedi has depreciated by approximately 24% against the US dollar, placing it as the fourth weakest currency in the region. Leading the list of the worst performers are South Sudan’s pound, which has lost over 60% of its value, followed by Ethiopia’s birr (51%) and Nigeria’s naira (over 40%).\n\nIn contrast, the Kenyan shilling has emerged as the best-performing currency in Sub Saharan Africa, appreciating by 21% year-to-date as of August 2024.",

   "source": "The High Street Journal",
   "Content": "It has emerged that Ghana’s tax revenues are heavily dependent on Corporate Tax, Personal Income Tax (PIT), and Value Added Tax (VAT), raising questions about the narrow nature of the country’s tax system.\n\nA survey on Ghana’s tax system conducted by the Ministry of Finance, the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), and the UK’s Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) with support from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has revealed that the growth in the tax revenue of Ghana since 2000 has been largely driven by corporate taxes, income taxes, and VAT.\n\nAs of 2022, these three taxes accounted for about 70% of the country’s total tax revenue collections. This is a significant increase from 57% in the year 2000.\n\n“Much of the growth in Ghana’s tax revenues since 2000 has come from increased corporate and personal income tax takes, and VAT and similar taxes, though revenue growth from the PIT and VAT-type taxes has stagnated more recently,” a statement released by the Ministry of Finance read.\n\nThe Ministry further confirmed that, “these three types of tax made up nearly 70% of total collections in 2022 – up from 57% in 2000.”\n\nThe outcome of the survey reveals that these three taxes are the backbone of Ghana’s tax revenue although Personal Income Tax and VAT have experienced a stagnation recently.\n\nExperts are raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of Ghana’s tax revenue given the overreliance on just three forms of taxes.\n\nThis dependence on corporate, income, and VAT-type taxes puts the country at risk of revenue shortfalls if growth in these areas continues to slow.\n\nThis situation calls for attention to the need for broader tax reforms to diversify Ghana’s revenue sources. Such reforms would not only improve the stability of tax revenues but also ensure a fairer distribution of the tax burden across all segments of the economy.",

Flywheel Advisory founder and executive director Grace Mburu says the summit will serve as a platform for all stakeholders to collaborate and devise comprehensive strategies and measures to address these challenges.\n\n“Financial crime is evolving and we need to develop appropriate strategies to counter money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing if we are to remove Kenya from the FATF grey list,’’ Mburu said.\n\nKenya was placed on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in February 2024 after an evaluation of the country’s adherence to global standards and recommendations for combatting money laundering and related financial crimes found weaknesses.\n\nMburu added that there is a need to put in place measures to detect and prevent illicit funds from being cleared through the non-financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs) which include real estate agents, casinos, betting companies, dealers in precious metals, precious stones, cars, accountants, trust and company service providers, advocates, and independent legal professionals.",

   "source": "The High Street Journal",
   "Content": "Togo is currently offering cocoa beans at nearly double the price Ghana’s Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) provides, which has led to rampant smuggling of cocoa beans from Ghana to Togo. In Togo, cocoa is being sold for 3,500 CFA per kilogram, which is equivalent to about GH¢93,300 per tonne. This contrasts sharply with the GH¢48,000 per tonne recently offered by COCOBOD, a difference of 94%. In comparison, Ivory Coast offers around 1,800 CFA per kilogram, equivalent to GH¢48,110 per tonne, slightly higher than Ghana’s rate.\n\nThe Coordination Committee for Coffee and Cocoa (CCFCC), Togo’s equivalent of COCOBOD, sets its official price at 2,800 CFA per kilogram, but the actual market price has risen to 3,500 CFA. This higher price has attracted cocoa traders from Togo to make irresistible offers to Ghanaian cocoa farmers, encouraging them to smuggle their beans across the border.\n\nA farmer in Ghana’s Eastern Region told The High Street Journal that he never considered selling his farm to illegal miners because the profits from selling cocoa to Togo traders are substantial.\n\nCOCOBOD has reported that it lost approximately 120,000 tons of cocoa to smuggling between 2022 and 2023, while Ivory Coast suffered a loss of 150,000 to 200,000 tons in the 2023-24 crop year.\n\nMost of the smuggled beans from Ghana end up in Togo while cocoa smuggled from Ivory Coast typically heads to Liberia and Sierra Leone, these countries also offer better prices than the Ivorian farmgate price.\n\nCocoa farmers in Ghana and Ivory Coast continue to receive much less than the global market price, which recently peaked at $11,000 (GH¢176,110) per tonne but has since dropped to $7,700 (GH¢123,277) per tonne.\n\nTo curb smuggling, COCOBOD will need to do more than moral suasion and its recent price increase, possibly raising the farmgate price further to better compete with Togo’s lucrative offers.",

The Foundation’s approach revolves around fostering economic empowerment, leadership training, and advocacy for women and girls. These initiatives aim to tackle the systemic obstacles that limit girls’ access to education and opportunities, paving the way for them to excel in sectors traditionally dominated by men, including technology and science.\n\nThrough its “STEM for Her” initiative, the Foundation has reached over 2,000 girls, primarily in rural areas, equipping them with essential skills in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This program not only fosters an interest in these fields but also focuses on global challenges like climate change by integrating mentorship and hands-on learning opportunities. The initiative is designed to inspire the next generation of female innovators and leaders.\n\nSterling One Foundation also prioritizes tackling gender-based violence (GBV), with over 3,000 beneficiaries reached so far. In collaboration with key partners like the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the British High Commission, the Foundation has rolled out awareness campaigns, advocated for stronger protective policies, and provided critical support to survivors. These partnerships aim to create safe environments for girls to pursue their aspirations.\n\nCommenting on the importance of this year’s theme, Olapeju Ibekwe, CEO of Sterling One Foundation, stated, “Empowering girls to realize their vision for the future is essential for building a more equitable society. Our programs focus on giving them the tools and opportunities they need to lead and succeed.”",

   "Content": "Ghana’s payment system is set to experience a massive disruption as Visa Ghana is ramping up efforts to accelerate the introduction of a contactless payment system.\n\nThe contactless payment system, Visa Ghana says, is an innovative modern financial technology that enhances the convenience of digital transactions and boosts financial inclusion.\n\nThe company made this case at a workshop themed “Securing the Future of Payments through Acceptance” to update and consult industry stakeholders on the agenda. Present include banks, fintech firms, merchants, regulators, and others.\n\nThe workshop also aimed at addressing the challenges and mapping out strategies to accelerate the acceptance and adoption of a contactless payment system in Ghana.\n\nContactless Payment Technology enables a customer to make payment without using cash or swiping the card. With some of these technologies, customers either “tap” or wave their card over a card reader to make payment.\n\nCountry Director of Visa Ghana, Fabrice Konan says this technology offers a faster experience, enhances the security of transactions and is very convenient.\n\n“Contactless payments are faster, more secure, and just as convenient as other methods,” he said at the Workshop.\n\nHe further revealed that while contactless payment is gaining ground in the world, Ghana is lagging behind as only 10% of transactions use the technology. He further noted that there is a chance for contactless payment to penetrate Ghana’s payment system since many Ghanaians who travel abroad quickly embrace the technology.\n\n“Ghanaians are quick to embrace contactless payments when they travel abroad with one in two transactions being contactless. In markets like South Africa and Mauritius, contactless penetration rates are close to 60% which shows we have a lot a lot of catching up to do,” Konan explained.\n\nHe attributed the low adoption rate not to a lack of awareness but to entrenched consumer habits. Many Ghanaians remain more comfortable with traditional payment methods like physical cards or mobile money, despite the superior speed, security, and convenience of contactless options.\n\n “Changing payment habits takes time, but once consumers experience the benefits of contactless technology, we’re confident they will make the switch,” Konan said.\n\nVisa Ghana’s initiative aligns with its broader goal of fostering a cashless society in Ghana and providing industry leaders with the knowledge and resources to support the adoption of modern payment technologies.",

   "source": "My Joy Online",
   "Content": "Shipowners and Agents Association of Ghana (SOAAG), the umbrella body of shipping lines and their local representatives operating in the country, has refuted claims that its members are ripping off shippers with arbitrary fees and charges at the ports.\n\nAddressing journalists in Tema, the leadership of the association emphasized that every shipping line charge or fee is tied to a specific service that has been rendered to the shipper, and that they were legitimate and globally applicable.\n\nAccording to SOAAG, when a shipper approaches a shipping line, there is dialogue, an offer and conditions that are agreed upon by both parties in contract—including the destination/local administrative charges.\n\nAn executive member of the association, Mr. Adam Imoru Ayarna, indicated that shipping lines were open to the reintroduction of terminal handling charges in Ghana to foster transparency and cohesion in the application of port charges.\n\n“With terminal handling charges, we [shipping lines] can bundle and itemize all the local charges, clearly stating the charges that emanates from origin and destination, respectively,” he said.\n\n“We suggested this sometime ago and it was fought vehemently; but I think it’s high time we reconsidered introducing THCs going forward so we can identify the cost drivers in the consolidated freight that is issued to the shipper, if we want international best practices,” Mr. Ayarna added.\n\nAccording to him, shipping lines cannot trade with basic ocean freight alone—which is the cost of the ship sailing from origin port to destination port, hence there are add-ons and surcharges to cushion them from other cost variables which they do not control.\n\n“Making allegations about a service charge that you think is not right does not solve the issue because it takes two to tango; besides, these charges are not illegitimate,” Mr. Ayarna further stressed.\n\nOn her part, the executive secretary of SOAAG, Madam Perpetua Osei-Bonsu, indicated that it was not right for stakeholders to single out shipping lines for blame with regards to the high cost of doing business in the port.\n\nAccording to Madam Osei-Bonsu, the media engagement formed part of an ongoing activity to sensitize shipping stakeholders about the business processes of shipping lines as a way of eliminating various misconceptions associated with their dealings with the shipping public.\n\n“We also recognize the need to throw more light on the operations of our members and their immense contributions to the growth of Ghana’s shipping sector,” she said.\n\nShe added: “By this media engagement, we anticipate that you will be empowered to provide compelling and impartial reportage on issues relating to the activities of shipping lines in Ghana. It is an opportunity to highlight the relentless commitment of our members to create vibrant businesses in the maritime industry.”",

   "Content": "GOIL, TotalEnergies and Shell which used to be the big players in Ghana’s downstream petroleum sector have been losing out on market share in the last few months, data from the National Petroleum Authority, (NPA) has shown.\n\nAccording to the NPA, petrol and diesel sales of GOIL, TotalEnergies and Shell declined in August, 2024 compared to January, 2024.\n\nThe data shows that GOIL sold 56,281,500 litres for diesel and petrol in January but as at August, it was doing 52,886,500 litres representing a variance of about 6% decline.\n\nTotalEnergies did 31,302,000 litres in January but as at August, it was doing 30,294,000 which reflects about 3% decline.\n\nLastly, Shell did 37,004,700 litres of petrol and diesel in August compared to 38,651,600 litres of same products in January representing about 4% decline.\n\nReacting to the revelation, Energy Analyst and Executive Director for the Center for Environmental Management and Sustainable Energy (CEMSE), Benjamin Nsiah said the three dealers must take a relook at their pricing strategies to offer competitive pricing that support the growth in retailing of petrol and diesel to avert.\n\n“These companies should also relook the margins they offer their dealers in order to attract and retain the dealers”, he said.\n\nThe three companies are also reported to pay low salaries to their employees due to the low volumes and margins offered.\n\nMr. Nsiah charged the OMCs to offer at least 50% of the margin to the dealers otherwise the companies will lose most of them to outlets with better contracts.\n\n“The 6% decline by GOIL, 3% decline by TotalEnergies and 4% decline by Shell imply that, revenues of dealers of each of the listed OMCs have declined respectively although their costs structures remain constant or seen an upsurge. These constant costs include compensations including SSNIT, Cost on credits (Interests payments), Utility Bills, Sanitation and Hygiene bills, and localized payments to their operational districts.\n\nA comparative analysis of the data published by the NPA shows that, dealers who work with GOIL made revenues ranging from GH₵23,000 to GH₵38,000 in January depending on their dealers’ margins but in August they declined with new revenues ranging from GH₵21,000 and GH₵36,000. Also, Shell dealers were making revenues ranging from GH₵28,000 to GH₵60,000 in January but in August, revenues declined from GH₵26,000 to GH₵27,000 and Dealers working with TOTAL Energy had revenues ranging from GH₵20,000 to GH₵35,000 in January but in August, revenues declined to GH₵18,000 to GH₵32,000” he stressed.\n\nAn observational inquiry by CEMSE among some dealers revealed that, dealers are unable to recover cost because of lower dealers’ margins as well as recently low sales being observed in the market.",

Proshare Analysts Key Views\n\n. Nigeria’s September inflation and Key Highlights\n\n. The 9M 2024 Inflation Journey\n\n. Inflation Across Nigerian Regions and States \n\n. Analysts Thought: Opinion and Outlook\n\n. Concluding Thought\n\n \n\nProshare Analysts View\n\n. Proshare analysts believe that the headline inflation rate will average 32.57% in 2024, diverging from the CBN’s 21.40% inflation target.\n\n. Proshare analysts expect the CBN MPC’s hawkish policies will persist for the rest of the year.\n\n. The hawkish outlook hinges on inflation conditions currently averaging 32.77% in 9M 2024, weak exchange rate amidst import dependence for raw materials, and import-dependent structural drivers, which will continue to dampen the positive prospects for inflation moderation.\n\n. Fiscal and monetary policy announcements not backed by urgent/aggressive actions to cushion household and business difficulties. The welfare-burning effects of policy hawkishness will exceed the welfare-building impacts of government short-term policies.\n\n \n\n \n\nNigeria’s September 2024 Inflation \n\nIn the August inflation commentary, Proshare analysts described the moderations in inflation in July and August 2024 as artificial. The analysts noted that “flood alert in 28 states, the PMS price war (hovering above N900/litre), drought in the northeast region, insecurity, and a stable but weak naira relative to the dollar could reverse gains driven by food inflation in coming months.” \n\n \n\nNigeria’s inflation grew by 0.55% to 32.70% in September 2024, up from 32.15% in August 2024 and 26.72% in September 2023. This marks a reversal in the moderation observed in the previous two months, aligning with analysts' expectations. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data reveals that the September 2024 inflation rise was driven by food and non-alcoholic beverages (16.94%), housing and energy (5.47%), clothing (2.50%), and transport (2.13%) division.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nKey Highlights\n\n1. Headline inflation grew by 0.55% points Year-on-Year (Y-o-Y) to 32.70% in September 2024 from 26.72% recorded in September 2023.\n\n2. Food inflation increased by 7.13% points (Y-o-Y) to 37.77% in September 2024 from 30.64% in a similar period in 2023. \n\n3. Core inflation rose from 21.84% in September 2023 to 27.43% in September 2024.\n\n4. The northeastern region of Nigeria had the highest headline inflation at 35.26%, while the south-south region had the lowest headline inflation at 31.20%, in September 2024\n\n5. The northwest region recorded the highest food inflation (40.82%), while the northcentral had the lowest food price growth (36.37%) in September 2024.\n\n6. Bauchi state had the highest headline inflation in September 2024 (44.83%), while Delta state recorded the lowest (26.35%).\n\n7. Sokoto State had the highest food inflation at 50.47%, while Kwara State had the lowest food prices at 32.45% in September 2024.\n \n\nThe 9M 2024 Inflation Journey\n\nInflation averaged 33.77% at 9M 2024, relative to 23.31% in 9M 2023, driven by high food prices and structural factors. Food inflation and core inflation rose to 38.92% (26.08%) and 26.48% (20.02%) in 9M 2024 (9M 2023). Current conditions dampen the prospects of the CBN target inflation rate of 21% at the end of 2024.\n\n\n\n \n\nInterest rate increases have mainly contained the rising prices of goods and services, while real interest rates have remained negative for the 20th consecutive month. During the 9M 2024 period, gross reserve conditions have improved, and growth has remained more robust than anticipated for a high-interest rate environment. Proshare analysts believe the strong growth conditions can be attributed to weak but improving purchase managers index (PMI) conditions and surplus trade balance.\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThe Inflation Story Across Nigeria\n\n \n\nOverall, general price levels across all regions have risen except the northeast and northwest. These conditions may be attributed to floods and insecurity in the northeast and drought conditions in the northwest. High energy prices, housing, transport, and food spur higher consumer price indices across the regions. High agricultural commodity yields in the country's northcentral and middle belt have seen the region record the lowest level of food prices in September 2024.\n\n \n\nBauchi State was ranked with the highest inflation for the fourth consecutive month since displacing Kogi State in June 2024. Notably, states in the northeast and northwest dominate the rankings of the highest-inflation states. Delta, Benue, and Katsina recorded the lowest headline inflation in September 2024.\n\n\n\n \n\nSimilarly, states in the northeast and northwest dominate the states with the highest food prices in September 2024.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnalysts' Thoughts and Outlook\n\n \n\nDr. Tilewa Adebajo, CEO, CFG Advisory\n\nThe September 2024 inflation rise “is not a surprise, as the pass-through effect of the increase in fuel pump prices is beginning to manifest. October inflation numbers will eventually determine MPC reaction.”\n\n \n\nDr Paul Alaje, Senior Economist, SPM Professionals\n\n“The real cause of inflation is monetary, and prices will likely rise further in October.” \n\n \n\nMr. David Adonri, Highcap Securities\n\n“I disputed the veracity of two previous inflation figures because they did not reflect the reality on the ground...the equities market is no longer responsive to the deteriorating macro-economy. I do not expect any impact on equities, but MPC could have another interest rate hike to tighten the money supply further.”\n\n \n\nMr Olutoyin Ayoade, MD, MBC Securities\n\n“We still expect a bullish run and increased buying interest in the equity market...we expect investors to position themselves for final year dividends...we expect the next inflation rate for October, which will be released November 15, to be higher than the September rate...we do not expect a rate cut in the next meeting. If the MPC decides to increase the rate, they might reduce the rate on fixed income instruments to reduce DMO obligation and money in circulation or increase the rate marginally.”\n\n \n\nMr. Samuel Sule, CEO of Renaissance Capital Africa\n\n“The fixed income markets are expected to remain driven by inflation and the monetary authorities' conventional policy of reacting to this and other key macro indicators. The higher inflation number equates to a lower probability of monetary easing at the next MPC meeting.”\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing Thoughts: \n\n \n\nCurrently, households and businesses remain under immense pressure, faced with high PMS/energy costs, high borrowing costs, weak exchange rates, and high supply chain and logistics costs amid other uncertainties. In September 2024, overall confidence in Nigeria’s macroeconomy remains weak but is anticipated to improve in the months ahead. We believe inflation risks driven by structural factors such as insecurity, climate risks, PMS scarcity, and energy costs will persist in October 2024. \n\n \n\nWe expect inflation to average above 32.57% in 2024, significantly higher than the CBN’s target of 21%. Proshare analysts note the need for the following:\n\n \n\n1. Greater fiscal and monetary policy coordination\n\n2. A whole-of-government approach to policy implementation\n\n3. Ramping up of foreign reserves\n\n4. Diversification of export revenues\n\n5. Optimisation of idle public sector assets through financialisation and securitisation\n\n6. Adopting an asset-centric approach to governance as against the prevailing income-centric framework\n \n\nThere is an urgent need to implement policies that ease the restraints on the welfare/prosperity of corporations and households, as aggressive monetary and fiscal policies hurt corporate performance and household prosperity and sustainability.\n\n \n\nDownload the PDF here\n[https://proshare.co/articles/report-nigerias-september-2024-inflation-rises-to-32.70-9m-2024-inflation-journey-vs-cbn-targeting-policy?menu=Reports&classification=Read&category=Proshare%20Analyst%20Reports]",

At the core of the discussions were valuable insights from the keynote speaker, Mrs Bola Adesola, and Panellists, who emphasised the critical need for organisations to evolve in governance practices and leadership mindsets to ensure long-term survival and growth.\n\n \n\nDuring her keynote address, Mrs Bola Adesola highlighted the increasing pressures companies face in today’s challenging global environment. She focused on the central role of leadership in driving sustainable growth, adding that boards and executives must lead with a vision that integrates governance with forward-thinking strategies. She shared that sustainability is not limited to environmental practices but encompasses the holistic health of an organisation: financial, social, and ethical.\n\n \n\n\"Corporate governance today must go beyond compliance. It’s about fostering resilience and trust in organisations to withstand future shocks and remain viable. This is the essence of survival,\" she said while further stressing the growing importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, urging leaders to embed these principles into the DNA of their companies to build lasting value.\n\n \n\nOne of the keynote address's most compelling themes was the call for transparency and trust as foundational elements of sustainable governance. She pointed out that businesses prioritising openness in their operations, decision-making, and communications will cultivate more robust relationships with stakeholders, securing their reputations and improving long-term financial performance.\n\n \n\nThe first plenary discussion, led by Alwin Magimay, also contributed to the dialogue by exploring the role of artificial intelligence and its potential to be redefined by corporate governance. He shared that technology can revolutionise business models but must be strategically governed to align with broader corporate objectives. Organisations must remain agile, adapting governance frameworks to accommodate rapid technological advancements while safeguarding sustainability.\n\n \n\nUltimately, the future of corporate governance is interdependent with survival and sustainability. In today’s fast-paced world, where artificial intelligence risks and environmental concerns dominate, companies that want to thrive must balance immediate business demands with long-term sustainability goals. This balance is at the heart of modern governance, ensuring companies survive and emerge stronger from challenges.\n\n \n\nAbout the Society for Corporate Governance Nigeria\n\nThe Society for Corporate Governance Nigeria is a not-for-profit organisation promoting best practices in corporate governance. Through advocacy, research, and education, SCGN shapes governance frameworks across sectors, ensuring that businesses are well-positioned for sustainability and long-term success in a dynamic global economy.

   "Content": "The Agricultural Development Bank (ADB) PLC, as part of its two-year corporate strategy, embarked on an aggressive recovery exercise, leading to the successful recovery of over 500 million Ghana cedis non-performing loans (NPLs) in just nine (9) months.\n\nThe actual total amount recovered from January to September 2024 stands at Five Hundred and Fourteen Million, Nine Hundred and Ninety-Nine Thousand Ghana Cedis (GHS514.99 Million).\n\nThe Bank’s NPL’s portfolio is largely made up of years of bad legacy loans. In a bold step to address this, management took measures to resource the Bank’s Recovery Department to ensure aggressive recovery of all non-performing loans as part of its 360-degree recapitalization agenda.\n\nThe achievement, by the Management and Staff, is a testament to the Bank’s unwavering commitment to cleaning its books, fostering prudent lending practices and robust risk management, whilst also protecting its customers and upholding best practices.\n\nAccording to the Managing Director (MD) of ADB, Alhassan Yakubu-Tali who is less than 2 years in office, the Bank’s recovery strategy coupled with the expertise and perseverance of the Recovery Department are the results of the impressive feat which has helped enhance shareholder value.\n\nThe Bank’s improved risk management practice has also gone a long way to significantly reduce its non-performing loans, engender confidence, and strengthen its financial stability.\n\n“Our proactive approach to loan recovery has paid off. We will continue to work closely with regulatory bodies to ensure the integrity of our loan portfolio and maintain the highest standards of risk management,” said the MD. The aggressive recovery exercise so far has greatly impacted the Bank’s operations, augmented our comprehensive recapitalization agenda, and has put the Bank on the path of sustained growth and profitability. He emphasized.\n\nThe General Manager (GM) in charge of recoveries, Sylvia Nyante stated that the successful recovery rate reflects the commitment of all stakeholders to ensure the achievement of the Bank’s recovery objectives.\n\n“Management took a bold decision as part of the strategy to focus on recovery which is yielding significant results,” Madam Sylvia said. “The objective of this exercise is to ensure total recovery of all historical NPLs, and so we want to thank all our stakeholders and customers for their support in this process so far,” she added. “We will continue to intensify our collaborative efforts with all stakeholders for a successful exercise,” Madam Sylvia further added.\n\nThe Agricultural Development Bank PLC is one of the biggest universal banks in the country, and a leader in agribusiness financing.\n\nThe Bank has recorded strong financial performance from all indicators including deposits, profitability and asset growth.\n\nIt also won several five (5) star awards at the recently held CIMG Customer Satisfaction Index Report Launch and Awards night.",

   "Content": "Ghana’s rapidly expanding digital economy is set to drive future economic growth, according to business and trade experts who gathered for a roundtable discussion in Accra on October 8.\n\nThe event, organized by the International Perspective for Policy and Governance (IPPG), was held under the theme, ‘Navigating the Current Business Environment in Ghana: Impacts on Foreign Trade and Opportunities for International Collaboration.’\n\nThe discussion brought together experts from foreign missions, chambers of commerce and industries, and state agencies to examine the effects of the evolving business landscape in Ghana and discuss ways to enhance cross-border trade and partnerships.\n\nDigital Economy: Ghana’s Next Frontier for Growth\n\nWhile recognizing the importance of traditional sectors like agriculture, mining, and manufacturing to Ghana’s economy and trade revenues, participants at the roundtable acknowledged the growing impact of the services sector. ICT, e-commerce, and fintech have become driving forces behind Ghana’s post-COVID-19 economic recovery.\n\nBusinesses offering software solutions, digital platforms, and e-commerce services have thrived in recent years, showing resilience even during the country’s economic downturns, which indicate their potential for job creation and economic stability.\n\nThey also present new opportunities for innovation and global market accessibility, according to the experts.\n\nInvestment Climate and Policy Challenges\n\nAlthough the services sector has demonstrated robust growth and potential, the roundtable participants warned that outdated regulations and cumbersome processes continue to stifle innovation and foreign investments in Ghana. Regulatory bottlenecks in sectors like IT, manufacturing, and trade were cited as major barriers to progress.\n\nAccording to the experts, these issues have led some companies to explore alternative markets, such as Ivory Coast, where entry requirements are more predictable and less restrictive.\n\nAdditionally, recent changes in the Energy Commission’s electricity bulk customer category have raised concerns among businesses, as the changes affect their cost structures and investment decisions. Despite these hurdles, it came to fore that Ghana’s Free Zones Authority continues to provide incentives for businesses to make the country an attractive destination for foreign investment.\n\nThese incentives, along with infrastructural developments in the free zone areas, have allowed businesses in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and services to flourish.\n\nThe participants called on policymakers to streamline regulatory frameworks to create a more investor-friendly and predictable environment that supports both traditional and emerging sectors to ensure balanced and sustainable growth across the country’s economy.\n\nEncouraging value-added manufacturing processes and service-oriented exports were seen as essential in this effort. The consensus among the experts was that streamlining regulatory frameworks could stimulate further growth, investments, and innovation to make Ghana more competitive on the global stage.\n\nHuman Capital Development\n\nAnother key issue addressed during the roundtable meeting was the urgent need for Ghana to develop a skilled workforce to meet the demands of emerging industries. The experts emphasized the importance of investing in education and vocational training programs, particularly in technology and services, while also building capacity in the manufacturing sector.\n\nIt was also recommended that the government create incentives to foster partnerships between businesses and educational institutions, which would enhance practical training opportunities and better align skills with industry needs. As digital trade, e-commerce, and IT continue to grow globally, Ghana’s ability to produce a tech-savvy workforce will be critical to sustaining economic growth and attracting high-value investments.\n\nStrategic Partnerships and International Collaboration\n\nStrategic partnerships between Ghanaian businesses and international companies are essential to sustaining the country’s economic momentum. Sectors such as the pharmaceutical industry have benefitted from collaborations that allowed the transfer of knowledge, technology, and resources.\n\nThe experts emphasized that the future of Ghana’s economy depends on its ability to engage globally and capitalize on its strengths in both traditional and emerging industries. Ghana must utilize its diplomatic relations to strengthen business ties with global partners, attract investments, and stimulate innovation across sectors.\n\nGhana’s Competitive Advantage and Path Forward\n\nGhana’s peace and stability, coupled with its strategic location within West Africa offers a competitive edge, particularly in comparison to neighboring countries facing political and economic instability.\n\nHowever, to fully capitalize on this advantage, the roundtable participants agreed that bold reforms, innovative strategies, and a forward-looking policy approaches would be required to prepare the country to thrive in both traditional and emerging economic sectors.\n\nImportantly, the experts advocated for a national development plan that transcends political changes to ensure policy continuity and economic growth and stability.",

   "source": "Citi Newsroom",
   "Content": "The Institute of Energy Security (IES) has thrown its support behind growing calls for the merger of the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) and the Energy Commission of Ghana.\n\nThis proposal, which has been gaining traction among industry experts and policymakers, is seen as a way to streamline regulatory functions, reduce operational costs, and eliminate potential overlaps in the oversight of Ghana’s energy sector.\n\nIES argues that combining the two regulatory bodies into a single entity will not only lead to cost savings but also enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of energy regulation in Ghana.\n\nExecutive Director of IES, Nana Amoasi IV, believes that a unified regulatory authority would significantly improve policy formulation and implementation within the sector, which he said is critical given the current challenges facing Ghana’s energy landscape.\n\nNana Amoasi IV stressed that merging the PURC and the Energy Commission would address some of the energy challenges by streamlining decision-making processes and reducing bureaucratic delays.\n\n“Today’s power sector is played around regional bases. And in the West African power pool, all their regulators relative to the power, it is only one regulator. You don’t find PURC at one end and you don’t find an energy commission at one end. For policy formulation and implementation, I get from one command desk. So that is a good call.”",

   "source": "Citi Newsroom",
   "Content": "The Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), Joseph Boahene Aidoo, has revealed that Ghana lost an alarming 120,000 metric tons of cocoa beans to smuggling between 2022 and 2023.\n\nThis significant loss poses a major threat to Ghana’s cocoa industry, a vital sector of the national economy.\n\nThe smuggling of cocoa beans, a long-standing issue in Ghana, appears to have worsened in recent years, driven largely by the allure of favourable prices in neighbouring countries.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference held in Accra on Monday, October 14, Mr Aidoo expressed deep concern over the growing trend of cocoa smuggling, lamenting that despite concerted efforts by COCOBOD and other governmental agencies, little progress has been made in curbing the illicit trade.\n\nMr. Aidoo provided a detailed explanation of the situation, noting that an estimated 100,000 to 120,000 metric tons of cocoa were illegally transported out of Ghana during the two years in question.\n\nHe highlighted that the problem was especially pronounced in the 2022-2023 period. He explained that the root cause of the surge in smuggling lies in the dynamics of the international cocoa trading system, which has created incentives for smugglers to exploit price differences between Ghana and neighbouring countries.\n\n“About 100 to 120,000 metric tons of cocoa was smuggled out of Ghana, especially in the last two years. Now for last year and this year in particular, this has been so.\n\n“This has been so because the international market trading system is inverted. When you say it is inverted, it means that today, the spot price has become more appreciable.”",

   "Content": "The energy sector special purpose vehicle, E.S.L.A. Plc has successfully completed a 90 percent buyback of a GH¢1.04billion bond offer – aimed at restructuring the country’s energy sector debt.\n\nThe buyback reduces outstanding liabilities from the company’s Tranche E2, E3, E4 and E5 bonds, scheduled to mature between 2027 and 2033.\n\nThe buyback targets non-sovereign bondholders and provides an opportunity to sell bonds at par value. The offer opened on September 16, 2024 and was available until September 30, 2024; however this was extended with a new offer close date of October 14, 2024. The settlement is scheduled for October 30, 2024.\n\nBonds included in this arrangement are Tranche E2 (maturing October 2027), Tranche E3 (June 2029), Tranche E4 (December 2031) and Tranche E5 (September 2033).\n\nIn a statement issued last Friday, the company said: “We hereby encourage the remaining non-sovereign bondholders to tender their bonds promptly, as E.S.L.A. PLC will immediately after closure of the buyback offer exercise every option available to settle all remaining non-sovereign bondholders”.\n\nThe buyback is funded from a lockbox account, with the bonds backed by levies collected under the Energy Sector Levy Act. These bonds were originally issued to refinance the country’s energy sector debt and have been key instruments in the sector’s financial restructuring.\n\nFinancial health of E.S.L.A. Plc\n\nThis buyback offer follows a positive financial performance by E.S.L.A. PLC. According to its unaudited financial statements for the period ending June 2024, the company reported total assets of GH¢5.21billion – including GH¢3.28billion in cash and cash equivalents. Liabilities have also been steadily reduced, from                       GH¢4.91billion in June 2023 to GH¢4.77billion in June 2024. The buyback is expected to further reduce its outstanding bonds, which currently stand at  GH¢4.57billion.\n\nE.S.L.A. Plc also reported after-tax profits of GH¢95million for first-half 2024, showing a significant improvement over the same period for 2023.\n\nMarket analyst note that government’s primary objective with the E.S.L.A. bond buyback is to reduce losses associated with high borrowing costs, particularly coupon payments on long-term bonds.\n\nAccording to the Central Securities Depository (CSD), the total outstanding E.S.L.A. bonds amount to approximately GH¢5.5billion with an average annual coupon of 20 percent. Over the maturity horizon of these bonds, government could potentially save over GH¢5.1billion in future coupon payments.",

   "source": "The High Street Journal",
   "Content": "Ghana’s tax-to-GDP ratio remains low despite efforts to increase tax revenue through the integration of the Ghana Card with the Tax Identification Number (TIN). According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Finance, the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), and the UK’s Institute for Fiscal Studies, Ghana’s tax-to-GDP ratio reached only 13.8% in 2022, based on the year 2000 as a baseline. This represents just a six percentage point increase in over two decades.\n\nAlthough the integration of the Ghana Card may have expanded the tax base, it has not translated into an increase in tax collection. The Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, previously emphasized that using the Ghana Card as a tax identification number raised the percentage of adults with tax numbers from 4% to 85%. However, Deputy Finance Minister Dr. Alex Ampaabeng pointed out a couple of months ago that only 1.5 million out of the 7.9 million registered taxpayers (about 18%) are meeting their tax obligations.\n\nThis suggests that the tax base may have expanded to 85%, but it did not result in a corresponding increase in the number of people paying taxes. From the figures provided by the Deputy Finance Minister, only 18% of the 7.9 million registered taxpayers are fulfilling their tax obligations. This represents just 8.3% of Ghana’s adult population and roughly 8.67% of the total Ghana Cards issued.\n\nGhana’s tax-to-GDP ratio has historically been low compared to its peers, and analysts argue that simply issuing Ghana card number as TINs does not ensure increased tax payments as claimed by some people in authority. The government had set a target to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio to between 18% and 20% by 2027. However, estimates suggest that the tax-to-GDP ratio for the end of 2023 could be even lower at 13.4%. In 2022, Ghana ranked 16th out of 28 lower-middle-income countries in terms of tax-to-GDP performance.\n\nDespite ongoing efforts to enhance tax mobilization, the results indicate that much work remains to achieve the government’s tax revenue targets and to effectively leverage the expanded tax base.",

   "source": "The High Street Journal",
   "Content": "Sub-Saharan Africa is striving to get its fiscal house in order, but the progress has been slow and uneven. According to the World Bank Group Africa’s Pulse Report 2024, only 10 countries in the region are on track to achieve fiscal deficits below 3% of GDP or record surpluses in 2024, raising concerns about the region’s ability to stabilize its economic health amidst growing debt pressures.\n\nThe report indicated that with just 10 countries maintaining fiscal discipline by keeping their deficits below 3% of GDP or achieving a surplus, the majority of the region will continue to face significant challenges. As the report stated, high deficits would make it harder for countries to fund key sectors like infrastructure and social programs without accumulating more debt.\n\nThe report highlights that, while the median fiscal deficit across the region is expected to decline from 3.9% of GDP in 2023 to 3.3% in 2024, the majority of African countries are still grappling with larger fiscal imbalances. The report noted that factors like rising debt service costs and increasing interest payments continue to undermine the benefits of fiscal consolidation.\n\nAs governments attempt to address these issues, the report mentioned efforts such as cutting unnecessary expenditures by eliminating ghost workers from payrolls and reforming fuel subsidies. However, as the report pointed out, mounting debt is limiting their capacity to invest in critical sectors like infrastructure, human capital, and energy.\n\nThe region’s debt burden is also highlighted, noting that Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to pay approximately US$19 billion in interest on external debt in 2024. It emphasized that much of this debt is owed to private creditors and non-Paris Club governments, which has placed substantial pressure on fiscal balances.\n\nThe high cost of borrowing has hampered fiscal consolidation and increased the risk of debt distress, with more than half of the region’s International Development Association (IDA)-eligible countries already facing high debt distress or being on the brink of it. \n\nUnless governments take decisive steps to manage their debt more effectively and adopt more transparent debt management practices, fiscal sustainability will remain a challenge for much of Sub-Saharan Africa.",

Therefore, any formula seeking to exclude, alienate or disenfranchise any person, group or community for any reason is repugnant to the very essence of our nationhood,” the President explained.\n\nThis year’s Mashujaa Day celebrations were preceded by the Boma Yangu Week to showcase the achievements of the Affordable Housing Programme.\n\nCurrently, 124, 000 housing units are at various stages of completion at 75 sites in 37 counties, creating 160,000 jobs through the housing value chain.\n\nAdvertisement.

Scroll to continue reading.\nMore than 12.9 million Kenyans are already registered under the Social Health Authority. All public health institutions, along with 50 per cent of private facilities, have been onboarded to provide services.\n\nTo accelerate the Universal Health Coverage roll-out, the President announced that the Government will release KSh3 billion to pay outstanding payments to hospitals.\n\nHe called for patience as the Government undertakes healthcare reforms, saying: “In a matter of weeks, SHIF will be serving us efficiently and making the dream of Universal Health Coverage come true.”\n\nFurther, he assured former NHIF employees that they will not lose in the ongoing changes in the health sector.\n\nAdditionally, the Government will strengthen the provision of medical supplies through capacity upgrades and establishment of Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (Kemsa) regional distribution centres in Kisumu, Embakasi and Mombasa.\n\nAt the same time, President Ruto announced the Government’s investment of KSh7.4 billion to promote the Blue Economy, which currently contributes KSh20 billion annually to the economy.\n\nThese investments include KSh2.7 billion for the construction of fish landing sites and markets equipped with cold storage facilities at the Coast and in the Lake Victoria regions.\n\nAnother KSh1.7 billion in grants will be released to 617 fishing cooperatives and groups in the Coast region.\n\nMoreover, another KSh1.4 billion has been allocated towards the National Mariculture Resource and Training Centre in Shimoni, Kwale County.\n\nAdvertisement.

   "source": "Ghana Web",
   "Content": "African billionaire Aliko Dangote is wealthier than ever now that his long-awaited Nigerian oil refinery is up and running. But his mood suggests a man who just built his dream house only for the roof to start leaking.\n\nThe Dangote Refinery outside Lagos is the biggest single-train oil refinery in the world and one of the most complex, capable of processing most global crude types. It has the potential to transform Nigeria’s economy by making the country self-reliant for fuel. And it’s more than doubled his net worth to $27.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nHe said he wouldn’t wish the experience on his worst enemy.\n\n“I didn’t know what we were building was a monster,” Dangote, 67, said during a recent visit to New York. “The pressure was coming from different directions, people confusing us, disturbing us every day with different media stories that it will never work, it will never work, it will never work.”\n\nSince the refinery started running in January, there have been disagreements with the government and state oil company, as well as concerns over its impact on locals and the environment. Dangote is smarting from the blowback, his tone quickly shifting from warm to bitter as he runs through the challenges.\n\nFor Dangote, who made his first billions in cement, the refinery was the most audacious undertaking of his 46-year career. Building it took 11 years and $20 billion, three-and-a-half times as long and more than twice as much as initially planned. He financed most of it himself.\n\nUnparalleled Scale\n\nShort in stature with neatly-trimmed graying hair, Dangote is an industrialist on an unparalleled scale. The bedrock of his empire is commodities: mainly cement but also sugar, salt and flour. His fortune is an anomaly in a country where 40% of the population lives below the national poverty line and sizable wealth is often tied to oil holdings.\n\nDangote’s critics call him a politically-connected monopolist, but he’s proud of his role in building Nigeria’s manufacturing sector. Before he went into business, Nigeria imported most of its cement — a literal building block of developing markets. Now it’s a net exporter of the substance. With the refinery, he saw an opportunity to do the same for the country’s oil industry.\n\nHe quickly ran into problems. The original site for the refinery was scrapped after four years of wrangling with local officials over land issues, he said. Dangote moved the site south to Lagos state where he met more resistance, this time from residents facing relocation (some of whom are reportedly still awaiting full compensation).\n\nThe new plot turned out to be mostly swamp which had to be dredged, reclaimed and lifted nearly 5 feet (1.5 meters) to avoid flooding from rising sea levels. Dangote’s holding company built a dam, its own port, a massive granite quarry and bought 332 cranes.\n\nTwo years into construction, Covid hit. Some of its suppliers went bankrupt and the project locked down, with all workers required to stay on-site. Meanwhile, Dangote said he was paying $50 million to $60 million a year in interest for a $5.5 billion loan he’d acquired from a consortium of local banks.\n\nThrough it all, he said his goal was to address Nigeria’s economic paradox. The country is Africa’s biggest oil producer but a dearth of functioning domestic refineries meant it was exporting its own crude, refining it abroad, then re-importing it as fuel in a loop rife with waste.\n\nYet when Dangote’s refinery opened earlier this year it had to source crude from abroad, adding to its costs, because most of the country’s output was tied up in long-term contracts.\n\nIt points to the difficulty of turning a profit in a country with a spiraling currency, a history of popular fuel subsidies and steep refining costs. Negotiations with the government and the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. over foreign-exchange rates, crude supply and gas prices — all critical to Dangote’s bottom line — have sometimes been heated.\n\nFor most of his career, Dangote has had close relations with Nigeria’s leaders, who supported his economy-boosting factories. Not so with current President Bola Tinubu, who took office last year. In January, the anti-graft commission raided Dangote Group’s offices as part of an investigation into the foreign-exchange dealings of a former official. Dangote Group called the visit an “unwarranted embarrassment” and said it hadn’t been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nA spokesman for the Nigerian government declined to comment.\n\nThe cooling relationship has coincided with Dangote’s increasingly blunt tone. At a conference over the summer he compared the “mafia in oil” unfavorably to the drug mafia. He hasn’t been shy about his disregard for the state-owned NNPC, which is essential to helping him obtain local oil to refine.\n\nTo keep them sweet, he struck a deal in 2021 to sell them a 20% stake in the refinery at a $13.8 billion valuation. It hasn’t worked out perfectly – that stake was later winnowed to 7.2% — but he said the “good price” he offered was a necessity. If you try to fight them, he said, you will fail.\n\n“It’s an industry which you know is full of games,” he said. “It‘s an industry where people are very corrupt.”\n\nA spokesman for the NNPC declined to comment.\n\nTypically somewhat press-shy, Dangote’s sudden stridency is giving his public perception a boost, said Zainab Usman, a political economist and director of the Africa Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n“He made this $20 billion investment to help the country and there’s this sense that a cabal of corrupt politicians, who saw the refinery as a threat, are trying to frustrate him,” she said. “For him to be speaking very clearly about it has earned him a lot of respect.”\n\n‘Real Legacy’\n\nMaintaining wealth of any level has become substantially harder in Nigeria of late. The naira has lost more than two-thirds of its value against the dollar following Tinubu’s relaxing of foreign exchange restrictions.\n\nDangote boasts that 80% of his business is dollarized. Next year he said Dangote Group will be the biggest supplier of dollars to Nigeria, whose economic woes have been exacerbated by a shortage of the US currency.\n\n“Our strategy is whatever we do, we generate as much foreign exchange as possible,” he said. “That will shield us from the issues of currency devaluation in Africa.”\n\nDangote’s ties to his home country are deep. He’s lived in the same house, a Lagos mansion, for 34 years. But his assets, like those of most members of the extremely rich, are stateless, held by an entity based in the Cayman Islands called Greenview. He’s opening a family office in Dubai to diversify and manage his fortune that will be run by his daughter Halima, who moved there this summer.\n\nHe’s looking to co-invest in deals and potentially partner with other billionaires, similar to a fund he’s set up with friend David Rubenstein, co-founder of private equity firm Carlyle Group Inc.\n\nHe has a charitable foundation that donates millions of dollars every year but he wants to give away more, $10 billion over time. He talks of stepping back and transitioning the business to his children and other family members, including a grandson who’s finishing university next year. He laments that his daughters are already older than he was when he got his first private jet (age 23) and built his mansion (33).\n\nThe strain of building the refinery has piqued his interest in diversifying, though he’s proud that the industrial sector will define him.\n\n“I’m passionate about it because you’re going to leave a real legacy, especially in Africa,” he said. “I’m making my country and continent self-sufficient in things that they never ever dreamed of.”\n\nHe can’t resist drawing a comparison with Johann Rupert, the South African chairman of Cartier-owner Cie Financiere Richemont SA, who until recently was closing in on Dangote’s title of Africa’s richest person.\n\n“Sorry, it’s better than selling bags,” he chuckled mischievously. “Some people have done really well by that too but it’s not the same.”",

   "Content": "Former Minister of Finance, Seth Terkper, as asked government not to borrow to fulfil populist agenda, leaving the country overwhelmed with debt.\n\nRather, he called for prudent borrowing, which includes ensuring that loan terms and interest rates were manageable, investing borrowed funds to generate good returns, and building strong buffers for timely repayment.\n\nA populist agenda involves pursuing social and economic policies that stimulates growth and benefits to the poor amid elections, a practice that is often unsustainable.\n\nMr Terkper made the call during a virtual press briefing on Tuesday, October 15, on the back of Ghana reaching a Staff level agreement on the third review of the ongoing International Monetary Fund loan-support programme.\n\nHe noted that it was difficult for any country to complete a major infrastructure project by using its own resources on an annual basis, especially for Ghana where one project alone could take a huge portion of its total revenue.\n\nThat, he said forced countries, including Ghana to borrow, but cautioned against excessive borrowing to limit the accumulation of debt.\n\n“We have to look at debt in terms of borrowing to fulfil a populist agenda, which does not generate as much revenue as possible,” Mr Terkper, now, the Executive Director of the Public Financial Management (PFM) Tax Africa Network, said.\n\nThe former Finance Minister, called for increased domestic revenue mobilisation through reforms that would ensure that taxes were lowered and “nuisance” taxes were removed to encourage compliance among individuals and businesses.\n\nThat was because the country’s current revenue position would not be enough to finance its major infrastructure projects, including roads, railways, and airports, leading to the delivery of quality services to the public.\n\n“We need to borrow, but be prudent in borrowing… raise enough revenue, implement expenditure measures so that you’re in control of your expenditure and use electronic means to control them,” Mr Terkper said.\n\nHe called for the acceleration of debt repayment by taming debt, including arrears and deficits and not living beyond our means, and when we get additional revenues as commodities go up, we put something aside.\n\n“Government should treat debt and buffers like the way households do. Having gone through the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) programme, debt forgiveness, and now, debt suspension, we need to put in the structures, so that we don’t find ourselves in that situation again,” he said.",

   "Content": "Data from the Ghana Grains Council (GGC) indicate that dry spells and drought conditions have affected 1.8 million hectares of agricultural land in the country, resulting in crop revenue losses amounting to some GH¢22.2billion in 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe Council noted that the Northern and Savannah Regions – which are responsible for a significant portion of the country’s maize, millet, sorghum and rice – were hit the hardest.\n\nAccording to GGC, maize yields fell by 35 percent and rice production by 25 percent, with millet and sorghum yields dropping by some 20 percent this year.\n\nThe Council’s Executive Secretary, Emily Boahen – who was addressing stakeholders at the Ghana Grains Forum in Accra on Tuesday, said grains, particularly maize, have become essential to the country’s economy and their cultivation must be prioritised.\n\nShe said this commodity alone accounted for half of the country’s total cereal production, with over two million smallholder farmers depending on corn for their livelihoods.\n\nDespite opportunities, the grain sector, according to Madam Boahen, faces several challenges – including low productivity, inconsistent access to inputs for farmers, exposure to global market fluctuations and climate variability, among others.\n\nAddressing these challenges, GGC noted that it’s critical to ensure the grains sector continues contributing positively to Ghana’s economic growth and food security.\n\nApart from climate change and drought conditions which are banes of the grain production sector, GGC also confirmed that galamsey, post-harvest losses and market access remain key challenges.\n\nWith the country losing approximately 1.46 million hectares of tree cover in the last two decades – much of it due to mining activities and environmental degradation, the Council maintains these activities have degraded large tracts of arable land and polluted water-bodies…. which has further exacerbated challenges faced by farmers.\n\nEqually, postharvest losses in the grain industry remains alarmingly high, with estimates suggesting that 30-40 percent of grains are lost annually due to inadequate storage, transportation and processing facilities.\n\nThese losses, the Council explained, reduce the profitability of farming for smallholders and contribute to food insecurity.\n\nBut Madam Boahen said investment in rural infrastructure, including roads, storage facilities and market platforms, are key to reducing the losses and improving access to markets.\n\nShe said other complex challenges which must be addressed include expanding access to finance for farmers, strengthening regional collaborations, enhancing research and development among others.\n\nAbout the Ghana Grains Forum\n\nUnder the theme ‘Climate Change and Sustainable Food Security: Collaborative Responses to Ghana’s Grain Crisis’, the Forum was hosted to give stakeholders a platform for discussing multiple challenges which have overwhelmed the sector.\n\nA panel comprising seasoned agriculturalists and farmers, including first female Dean-School of Agriculture, University of Ghana, Prof. Irene Susana Egyir; Agriculturalist, Prof Abu Sakara; and CEO-Agri Impact, Mr. Daniel Fahene Acquaye among others.\n\nAt the Forum, the experts advised stakeholders to prioritise and display commitment to sustainable farming practices in order to enhance resilient food systems.\n\nStakeholders also admitted that the droughts have threatened to wipe out billions of cedis invested; and the ban on grain exports, though necessary, has a tendency to challenge local grain producers’ competitiveness.",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "Foreign investors have increasingly turned to Nigerian treasury bills in the first half of 2024, as money market instruments emerged as the leading contributor to capital importation during the period.\n\nTreasury bills, in particular, were heavily oversubscribed, reflecting strong investor appetite driven by favourable yields in Nigeria’s fixed-income market.\n\nThis surge highlights how rising yields, fueled by tighter monetary policy, have drawn both foreign and domestic investors seeking short-term returns.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) aggressive monetary tightening—marked by multiple interest rate hikes—has significantly enhanced the attractiveness of treasury bills.\n\nIn its effort to tame inflation and stabilize the naira, the CBN raised the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) from 18.75% in January to 26.25% by June 2024 and as of the time of writing this, the MPR is 27.25%.\n\nThe sharp rise in rates created a more appealing environment for fixed-income investments, particularly treasury bills, leading to a surge in demand.\n\nRising Yields Fuel Demand\n\nIn H1 2024, yields on treasury bills surged across all tenors, positioning them as a prime investment choice for both local and foreign investors.\n\nThe 91-day, 182-day, and 364-day bills offered attractive returns of 16.37%, 17.46%, and 20.62%, respectively—up from single-digit levels earlier in the year.\n\n-The sharp rise in yields positioned treasury bills as a preferred investment option for investors seeking high returns on short-term instruments.\n-During the period, the government offered N3.46 trillion worth of treasury bills for subscription. However, investor demand far exceeded the government’s expectations, with total subscriptions reaching N18.12 trillion—overshooting the original offer by a staggering 524.13%.\n-Despite this oversubscription, only 45.03% of the excess demand was met, with investors receiving N8.16 trillion, which is 236.03% more than the government’s initial offering.\n\nForeign Portfolio Investors Drive Market Growth \n\n-Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were pivotal in driving this surge in demand for money market instruments. FPIs invested $2.68 billion into Nigeria’s money market instruments, demonstrating the strong appeal of treasury bills amid a rising interest rate environment. The high-yield, short-term nature of treasury bills made them particularly attractive to foreign investors seeking quick returns in a relatively secure segment of the market.\n-Overall, foreign portfolio investments in Nigeria totalled $3.48 billion in H1 2024, with money market instruments accounting for the bulk of these inflows.\n-Compared to the $756.13 million recorded in H1 2023, the 2024 figures represent a 360% increase, signaling a renewed interest among foreign investors in Nigeria’s fixed-income assets.\n\nBottom Line \n\nThe surge in foreign investment in Nigerian treasury bills during H1 2024 highlights the impact of the CBN’s hawkish policies, which have significantly boosted yields, making government securities more appealing.\n\n-The oversubscription of treasury bills reflects strong investor confidence in Nigeria’s fixed-income market.\n-However, the preference for short-term investments also signals cautious optimism, as investors remain wary of long-term economic risks, including inflationary pressures and currency instability.\n-Sustaining this momentum will depend on the CBN’s ability to balance inflation control with currency stabilization to maintain investor confidence in the second half of 2024.",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "The importation of premium motor spirit (PMS), commonly known as petrol, into Nigeria, has significantly declined in the first two weeks of October as the Dangote Refinery increased production to meet local demand.\n\nThis is according to S&P Global Commodity Insights ship-tracking report published on Tuesday.\n\nData from S&P Global Commodities at Sea shows that only 280,400 barrels of gasoline and blend stock were imported into Nigeria during the first week of October, ending on the 6th, via a single Medium Range (MR) vessel.\n \nThis marks a sharp decline from the weekly average of 1.3 million barrels recorded in August.\n\nAccording to the report, in the week ending October 13, only one product tanker was reported to have shipped gasoline to Nigeria, carrying 290,567 barrels from Antwerp to Lagos.\n\nThese two October shipments are significantly lower than the 12 cargoes dispatched in the first half of both August and September.\n\nSince October 8, no additional gasoline shipments have been brought into Nigeria.\n\nThe report indicates that the decline in import activity marks the first disruption to the previously well-established flow of fuel, primarily from Northwest Europe to West Africa, driven by the emergence of Dangote refinery’s domestic refining capacity.\n\n“There is no schedule for gasoline coming from Europe to Nigeria at the moment. The rest will have to come from whatever is in the Offshore Lome market,” one trade source said, speculating that the new refinery might meet at most a quarter of domestic demand.\n\nMeanwhile, the report notes that traders have warned that Nigeria could still face a substantial fuel deficit in the absence of imported supply.\n\nWhat you should know\n\nFollowing the sale of crude oil to the Dangote Refinery in Naira earlier this month, the federal government authorized petroleum marketers to lift petrol directly from the 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) refinery, bypassing the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited.\n\nThis move marks the full deregulation of the downstream sector, signaling the end of the costly but widely supported fuel subsidy.\n\nSince September, the Dangote Refinery has supplied petroleum products to the market, with retail prices initially ranging between N850 and N900 per litre.\n\nHowever, with the NNPC no longer serving as the sole off-taker of petrol from the refinery, retail prices have risen from approximately N998 to N1,030 per litre.\n\nUpon reaching full operational capacity, the Dangote Refinery aims to meet local fuel demand while also exporting to neighbouring African countries and the Caribbean, thereby disrupting Nigeria’s petroleum importation industry.",

   "Content": "The Nigerian monetary policy committee may continue to increase interest rates in response to higher inflationary trends and weakening currency, the World Bank has said.\n\nThe Washington-based bank in its recent Africa’s Pulse report said that while other African countries have begun their easing cycles and lowering benchmark interest rates, Nigeria’s may remain elevated as cost pressures are yet to wane.\n\n“Central banks in countries that still have double-digit inflation and weakened domestic currencies (such as Angola, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone) will keep monetary policy rates higher for longer and, in fewer cases, they may increase their policy rates—particularly in countries where inflation rates still have not peaked,” the World Bank said.\n\nThe multilateral lender explained that currency weakness, slow fiscal adjustment, and cost pressures are among the factors driving these countries to keep a tighter stance for a longer period.\n\nNigeria has continued to grapple with high inflation and weakened currency following the removal of costly petrol subsidy and devaluation of its naira in 2023. This twin action has eroded purchasing power and worsened citizens’ living conditions.\n\nIn response to the rising price pressures, the Central Bank of Nigeria under Governor Olayemi Cardoso has continued to be hawkish in its monetary policy stance raising the interest rates by a cumulative 850 basis points to 27.25 percent within a year.\n\nBut this is yet to calm the tides of consumer prices which has now quickened to 32.7 percent in September after three months of declining. The naira has equally not budged and was even categorized among the worst performing currency in end-August.\n\n“Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria are among the worst performing in Africa this year, and their currencies continue weakening while demand for foreign exchange remains pressing,” the World Bank said.\n\nAnalysts have called for caution in raising rates, stressing that Nigeria needs real capital inflows to end its exchange rate crises which will trickle down on inflation.\n\nThey hinted that monetary policies, rather than ensure price stability will cripple business operations, lead to loss of jobs and strain consumer prices as high borrowing rates reduce investment expansions.",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a comprehensive reform and financing package for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), aimed at enhancing support for low-income countries.\n\nThe package, which includes a $8 billion subsidy over the next five years, was developed to provide much-needed concessional financing to help these nations manage unprecedented economic challenges.\n\nIMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, highlighted the significance of the reform in a press statement released on Wednesday saying the package for the PRGT would help tailor IMF support to country-specific needs, recognizing the increasing economic heterogeneity of low-income countries.\n \nPRGT’s annual lending capacity increased\n\nThe new framework enables the deployment of IMF net income and reserves to generate additional resources, with the goal of increasing the PRGT’s annual lending capacity to $3.6 billion — more than double the pre-pandemic level.\n\n- This, in turn, is expected to stimulate further contributions from both public and private sectors.\n\n- According to the IMF, this development comes at a critical time, as low-income countries have been hit hard by global economic shocks and continue to face considerable financing needs.\n\n- The IMF said it aims to channel the increased resources toward supporting these countries in implementing sound economic policies and building resilient institutions.\n\n- The reform also includes a new interest rate mechanism, ensuring that the poorest nations continue to receive interest-free loans while maintaining favorable lending terms for others.\n\n- Access policies have also been designed to offer flexibility, ensuring that IMF assistance is tailored to the unique needs of individual countries.\n\nNew Interest rate mechanism \n\nTo ensure that scarce concessional resources are targeted to those most in need, the IMF Managing Director in the statement said a new interest rate mechanism will maintain interest-free lending for the poorest countries while ensuring that lending terms for others have a sufficient degree of concessionality.\n\n“Access policies will allow for flexibility in calibrating Fund support, and safeguards will be strengthened and streamlined. \n\n“Our global membership has demonstrated once again its shared commitment to support our low-income members in challenging economic times,” Georgieva stated.\n\nWhat you should know\n\nThe World Bank defines low-income economies as those with a GNI per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method, of $1,145 or less in 2023, while lower-middle-income economies, where Nigeria is classified, are those with a GNI per capita between $1,146 and $4,515.\n\nIMF’s list of low-income countries as of 2024 shows that there are 68 of them in total. These include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Democratic Republic, Côte d’Ivoire Djibouti, Dominica, Eritrea Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Kiribati, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao P.D.R., Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, and Malawi.\n\nOthers are Maldives, Mali, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Micronesia, Moldova, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Samoa, São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Timor Leste, Togo, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Yemen, Republic of, Zambia and Zimbabwe.",

   "Content": "Oil companies operating in Nigeria have claimed that members of host communities are responsible for oil theft and pipeline vandalism in the region.\n\nThis assertion was made during a public hearing on oil theft, pipeline vandalism, and their impact on oil-producing states, organized by the House of Representatives in Abuja.\n\nThe companies pointed to environmental pollution in the South-South region, linking it to the destructive activities of vandals, particularly within the host communities.\n \nPhilip Akuduro, the Team Lead for Oando PLC, highlighted that a significant portion of oil spills is due to vandalism.\n\nAkuduro explained that many of the vandals, who are increasingly involved in crude oil theft through illegal connections and damage to oil infrastructure, are residents of the host communities.\n\nHe said, “Data by Oando on Burutu in Southern Ijaw revealed that over 90 per cent of oil theft and pipeline vandalism were perpetrated by members of the host communities.” \n\n“These vandals have increasing penance while their capacity to steal from the commonwealth knows no bound.” \n\n“They sabotage the efforts of oil companies to minimise incidences of spillages in their areas.” \n\n“Our operations covering largely onshore and marshy areas are easily accessible to vandals whose activities result in spillage and pollution of the environment as oil spills are swiftly spread by the strong underwater current,” \n\nMr. Ewarezi Useh, Chief Operating Officer of Aieto Group, a petroleum company, also attributed the decline in crude oil production to the actions of vandals.\n\nUseh emphasized the need for a harmonious relationship between oil companies and their host communities as a key solution to combating the problem.\n\nHe added that the joint efforts of security agencies have been effective, with crude oil production now beginning to show signs of recovery.\n\nRep. Julius Pondi (PDP-Delta), Chairman of the House Committee on Environment, reaffirmed the committee’s commitment to uncovering the causes of environmental degradation and pollution linked to oil company operations.\n\nPondi mentioned that the committee had scheduled an oversight visit to Oando’s operational sites in Delta State to verify claims that the company had cleaned up the oil spills that affected some communities in May.\n\nCrude oil theft in Nigeria  \n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) and the Ministry of Petroleum estimate that the country loses between 200,000 and 400,000 barrels of crude oil daily due to theft.\n\n- In a recent interview with Channels Television, NNPCL’s Group Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mele Kyari, revealed that since the crackdown on illegal refineries began in 2022, 8,684 sites—referred to as “boiling points” rather than actual refineries—were deactivated.\n\n- He also disclosed that 6,610 illegal pipeline connections were discovered, with 5,913 of them removed. Despite these efforts, Kyari pointed out that over 1,000 illegal connections remain, and new ones are reconnected daily, complicating the fight against oil theft.",

   "source": "CNBC Africa",
   "Content": "NAIROBI, Oct 16 (Reuters) – Kenya is in discussions with the United Arab Emirates for a $1.5 billion commercial loan with an 8.25% interest rate and a seven-year tenor, Finance Minister John Mbadi said on Wednesday.\n\nThe East African nation is seeking to diversify its sources of financing after deadly protests forced the government to abandon a slate of tax hikes and delayed disbursements from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Reuters reported the prospective loan last month.\n\n“This loan is cheaper than the Eurobond we borrowed at 10.7%,” Mbadi told a news conference, referring to a $1.5 billion dollar-denominated bond issued in February to partially buy back a portion of a maturing $2 billion Eurobond.\n\nKenya has satisfactorily answered the questions raised by the IMF around the country’s current lending programme, which was interrupted by the protests and the abandonment of the finance bill, Mbadi said. He will hold more meetings with the fund in Washington DC next week.\n\n“After that, the funds will be disbursed,” Mbadi said.\n\nThe IMF’s executive board will meet on Oct. 30 to consider the staff review of Kenya’s programme, Bloomberg news agency reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nAsked about the report, the Fund said the date had not yet been set.\n\n“No date has been confirmed yet for the Board’s deliberation. We will communicate the date and related information in due course,” it said.\n\nKenya would seek a new fund programme when the current one runs out next year, Mbadi said, but he called for more realistic fiscal targets to underpin future lending.\n\n“I completely believe some of the targets we have set with the IMF were unrealistic,” he said, citing a target of lowering the fiscal deficit to 3.8% this financial year from 5.2% in the year that ended in June, which has since been removed.\n\nRISK EXPOSURE?\n\nThe government is also talking with the IMF after the lender raised some concerns about the potential commercial loan from the UAE, the minister said.\n\n“There are issues to be discussed, including with the IMF, which had expressed some reservations, because we are talking about this being an external loan and is dollar-denominated, it may expose us to additional risk,” he said.\n\nThe government has countered that the loan was cheaper than the other options, including Eurobonds, Mbadi said.\n\n“Those are issues that we are discussing. We haven’t firmed them up. We are looking for the transaction adviser on the same,” he said.\n\nThe government has set the foreign borrowing target for this financial year at 168 billion shillings ($1.31 billion), while the UAE loan if finalised would bring in the equivalent of 195 billion shillings, helping the government to cut local borrowing.\n\nPresident William Ruto’s government has prioritised lowering elevated lending rates in the economy, Mbadi said, to support businesses and economic growth.\n\nPolicymakers cut the central bank’s benchmark lending rate by 75 basis points last week to 12%, but Mbadi said it should be at 10% or lower.\n\nUnder Ruto, who took over in September 2022, Kenya has forged closer ties with the UAE.\n\nThe UAE’s Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Emirates National Oil Company were among three Gulf firms Ruto’s government picked last year to supply Kenya with oil on longer credit terms, in a shift from an open tender system.\n\nThe UAE provided Ethiopia with $1 billion in 2018 to help with a severe hard currency cash crunch, and the central banks of both sides announced an $817 million swap line in July.\n\nThe UAE also signed a deal with Egypt earlier this year to develop a prime stretch of its Mediterranean coast that was expected to bring $35 billion of investments into the Egyptian economy.\n\n($1 = 128.5000 Kenyan shillings)\n\n(Reporting by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Angus MacSwan, Mark Potter and Gareth Jones)",

   "Content": "I broke this news in August and faced intense pressure from all quarters to retract my report.\n\nThe appointment of a Group Managing Director (GMD) for what is arguably Nigeria’s most important financial institution is a matter of great interest to all stakeholders.\n\nIt must be handled with care as it will impact the markets, and the economy, and, if mismanaged, could even affect political stability.\n\nOf utmost importance is the selection of the individual to wear this coveted cap. This decision cannot be made without careful and intense deliberation due to its far-reaching effects on various sectors.\n\nWhile the market held its breath, the Board and Shareholders of this critical institution took their time.\n\nFinally, they confirmed the appointment of the exceptionally brilliant banker and gentleman, Wale Oyedeji, as the substantive Group Managing Director, subject to approval by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nWale brings with him around 30 years of cognate experience, covering major critical areas of banking. He worked at GTBank and was, until recently, the MD/CEO of Nova Merchant Bank Limited.\n\nAbove all his credentials, Wale is a good man. I have known him nearly all my life. Our paths crossed from primary school through secondary school and even at the legendary University of Ibadan, making me wholeheartedly endorse this appointment.\n\nWale steps into office at a time when the industry is grappling with significant micro and macro challenges, pushing its leadership capacity to the limit.\n\nHis alma mater, GTB, is currently struggling with image issues due to unprecedented media attacks.\n\nThe industry itself faces public discontent over its massive profits amid a depressed economy, leading to growing concerns about its ethos and leadership.\n\nThe industry needs good men like Wale, who have built their careers on integrity, professionalism, and, most importantly, humanity.\n\nHe can help steer the sector away from hard-nosed capitalism and back to a people-driven approach, where banks serve as true partners to the real sector.\n\nIn a brief call with Wale this evening, I emphasized the need for him to maintain his credentials as a God-fearing professional who remains open to serious and sincere opportunities.\n\nHis job is cut out for him, as the market will expect a resurgence of FBN Holdings as a permanent leader in the space a position that has been lost to less robust leadership in recent times.\n\nHe must spearhead growth driven by principles of corporate governance, internationally recognized standards, and industry-wide leadership in these areas.\n\nWale’s task will be eased by the presence of an improved Board, led by Mr. Femi Otedola. Over the last five years, Mr. Otedola has waged a campaign to restore corporate governance, integrity, and shareholder respect to the banking industry, and he seems to be succeeding.\n\nThe renewed vigour with which FBN Holdings has pursued these goals is reflected in its results.\n\nI suspect that headhunting Wale was a deliberate and perfect fit for the brilliant chess game Mr. Otedola is playing at FBN.\n\nWale is no stranger to this. He was part of the golden era dream team at GTB, where he started his career and rose to the enviable position of Executive Director. He later served as a Non-Executive Director at Stanbic IBTC before becoming MD/CEO at Nova Merchant Bank.\n\nHe learned banking under legends like Fola Adeola and Tayo Aderinokun and was also close to Cathy Echeozo, who capped a brilliant career at GTB as Deputy Managing Director before her retirement.\n\nThrough these exposures, Wale developed a super-brilliant and personable approach to banking, earning him recognition as one of the most talented bankers in the industry.\n\nWith this appointment, I am confident the industry will be better for it. I must thank the Board of FBN Holdings for their immense wisdom in identifying this talent, and the Shareholders for creating an environment where above-board decisions like this can be made.\n\nUnlike some other institutions in the same space, where corporate governance is being trampled upon daily, FBN Holdings stands tall.\n\nWell done to the Board of FBN Holdings, well done to its Shareholders, and well done for a job excellently done.\n\nThank you.",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "The Governor of the Central Bank, Yemi Cardoso, stated that the sharp drop in the value of the naira presents an opportunity for the country to boost its exports to other nations.\n\nCardoso said this at the Nigerian Economic Summit on Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nThe CBN Governor noted that the naira’s devaluation has made it more competitive for export trade, with many investors already seizing the opportunity.\n\nCardoso acknowledged that while the situation is not ideal, the current climate offers a chance for individuals to identify and pursue investment opportunities.\n\n“In terms of persuasion, what we need now is to ensure that investments are here. Take, for example, now it may seem like a threat in the sense that the exchange rate has come down so low. But that also is an opportunity because what that means is that it can help to boost your exports.  \n\n“This will make Nigeria to become a lot more competitive in the export trade. I just want to encourage people to say that the opportunities are here. Things are recalibrating in a particular direction. It’s not perfect, but definitely there opportunities for people to single out and invest.  \n\n“By the time you are exporting out to other countries with the cost of import here and the relatively low naira, you will have a situation where the demands of your goods are much more. And I see it happening. Others are doing it and the interest is growing in leaps and bounds,” Cardoso said. \n\nCentral Bank Policies on the Right Track\n\nIn addition, Cardoso reiterated the position of the World Bank, stating that the policies of the CBN are on the right track.\n\nHe further disclosed that not only the World Bank but other financial institutions as well as rating agencies have commended the apex bank’s effort in transforming the economy.\n\nCardoso therefore stated that the bank needs to stay on course to fully reap the benefits of the policies set in motion.\n\n“The issue of the World Bank Chief Economist. I wasn’t here. But I read the speech. To be honest, my interpretation wasn’t how others perceived it. I think he was basically misunderstood.  \n\n“My understanding of what he said is that the policies that the policies that the Central Bank is taking are putting Nigeria on the right track.  \n\n“Frankly, I did not mention the World Bank when I said earlier that if you look at the rating agencies and other international financial institutions, it’s all the same thing. And they are all saying the same thing. And I doubt that they might all be wrong,” Cardoso added.  \n\nWhat you should know \n\nAs the value of the naira depreciated by over 170% in the past year, trading between 1,685/$ and 1,700/$ in the foreign exchange market, Nigeria has recorded a significant trade surplus, reaching N6.95 trillion in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n- This trade surplus is primarily driven by the weakened naira and a steep decline in imports, as the rising cost of importing goods and services has made foreign products increasingly expensive.\n\n- Many believe the weak naira presents an opportunity to boost the export of Nigerian goods, providing the country with more foreign exchange to help stabilize the currency.\n\n- The CBN governor emphasized that a depreciated naira enhances export competitiveness, giving Nigerian exporters a substantial advantage in international trade.",

   "Content": "The naira has lost ground, breaking the N16000/$ support level against the dollar in the official foreign exchange market, with the dollar index remaining firm amid a less dovish Fed outlook.\n\nData from the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market (NAFEM) revealed that the local currency depreciated by N106.05, trading at N1,658.97/$1, compared to Monday’s rate of N1,552.92/$1.\n\nForeign investors welcomed the devaluation of the naira and the removal of gasoline subsidies. However, for the general populace, these measures have exacerbated inflation and worsened the cost of living, leading to protests in recent months and a violent response from security forces.\n \nChief Economist Indermit Gill stated, “The naira’s real exchange rate is at its most competitive in at least 20 years.” Speaking Monday in Abuja at the Nigerian Economic Summit Group, he declared, “This is a great opportunity for the private sector.”\n\nAccording to Gill, the federal government’s reforms in the country’s FX market and energy sector from the previous year have saved Africa’s largest oil producer from fiscal collapse. Decades of mismanagement have left Nigeria with the highest percentage of people living in abject poverty globally. A World Bank analysis indicates that the Nigerian naira is among the least-performing currencies in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2024. The naira has lost approximately 43% of its value from January to August 2024, ranking it among the weakest currencies in the region, alongside the South Sudanese pound and the Ethiopian birr.\n\nTaiwo Oyedele, head of the Presidential Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms Committee, claims that international taxes paid by Nigerian businesses amount to an estimated $3.5 billion a year, contributing to the naira’s decline.\n\nU.S. Dollar Index Boosted by Strong U.S. Economic Data\n\nStrong jobs and CPI data have tempered expectations of a quick Fed relaxation, predicting a total reduction of 125 basis points over the next 12 months. Fed governors Kashkari and Waller have issued warnings, indicating a slower pace of rate cuts than initially anticipated.\n\nThe FedWatch Tool from CME Group (NASDAQ: CME) shows that traders are betting 92% on a 25-basis-point decrease when the Fed makes its next policy decision on November 7, with an 8% chance of no change. Over 29% of traders had predicted a substantial 50-basis-point drop a month ago. This sentiment also reflects traders’ calculations regarding a potential victory for former President Donald Trump, considered dollar-positive, and pricing in rate reductions from the Federal Reserve.\n\nRecent price action for the dollar index indicates a positive outlook as indicators gain momentum. After surpassing the 100-day SMA at 103.8 index points, the index is approaching the 200-day SMA, which will be a significant resistance level. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicators are flashing overbought signals, suggesting potential profit-taking.\n\nThe market is still pricing in 50 basis points of easing this year, but central bankers’ comments overnight were more hawkish. Raphael Bostic of the Atlanta Fed stated that he only plans to lower interest rates by 25 basis points this year, while Mary Daly of the San Francisco Fed further disclosed that “one or two” rate reductions in 2024 would be “reasonable.” Investors will be monitoring the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday; however, the market impact may be limited if policymakers deliver the currently anticipated 25-basis-point rate decrease and President Christine Lagarde withholds too many hints about the future outlook for interest rates",

However, total expenses increased by 77.83% to N4.4 billion.\n\nDespite the rise in expenses, pre-tax profit soared by 131.61% YoY, reaching N9.6 billion, up from N4.1 billion in Q3 2023. This brought United Capital’s cumulative pre-tax profit for the first nine months of the year to N18.7 billion, reflecting a 92.7% YoY increase.\n\nPost-tax profit saw significant growth, rising 118.14% year-over-year to N8.2 billion in Q3 2024. Additionally, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) jumped to N5.50, up from N2.52 recorded in the same period last year.\n\nGrowth in Assets \n\n- United Capital’s total assets grew significantly to N1.26 trillion as of September 30, 2024, a 35.66% increase from N931.9 billion a year earlier, amid an increase in cash reserves and receivables.\n\n- The rise in assets was fueled by a remarkable jump in cash and cash equivalents, which surged from N145.3 billion to N434.8 billion for the year, and trade and other receivables, which more than doubled from N85.5 billion to N195.9 billion.\n\n- However, liabilities also grew substantially, reaching N1.15 trillion, up from N841.2 billion in the previous year.\n\nCash Flow Performance \n\n- United Capital reported a strong cash position, with net cash and cash equivalents rising by N303.2 billion for Q3 2024, rebounding from a N4.1 billion decrease in the same period last year.\n\n- This recovery was powered by N90.4 billion in operating cash flows, despite fluctuations in trade receivables and currency volatility.\n\n- The company’s investing activities generated N113.9 billion in net inflows, driven by the disposal of investment securities, while financing activities contributed N98.9 billion, supported by new borrowings.",

   "Url": "https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/Fitch-assigns-Ghana-s-new-dollar-bonds-CCC-rating-1955695",
   "source": "Ghana Web",
   "Content": "Fitch Ratings has assigned a CCC+ rating to Ghana's new US dollar bond, issued on October 9, 2024.\n\nThe ratings agency also upgraded Ghana's Long-Term Local-Currency (LTLC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to CCC+' from 'CCC'.\n\nIt also affirmed Ghana's Long-Term Foreign-Currency (LTFC) IDR at 'RD'.\n\nFitch also has affirmed the 'CC' rating on Ghana's US dollar-denominated notes partially guaranteed by the International Development Association (IDA), part of the World Bank Group, due October 2030, and subsequently withdrawn the rating.\n\nThe issue rating for the IDA-partially guaranteed note maturing in 2030 has been withdrawn as the note will no longer exist because of its restructuring.\n\nFitch reported the upgrades below\n\nGhana has successfully concluded a debt exchange for its 15 outstanding non-performing Eurobonds, including the IDA-partially guaranteed notes.\n\nThis follows consent reached on 98.58% of the total outstanding amount, and each series has received consent representing more than 92% of outstanding principal, meeting the respective collective action clause thresholds.\n\nAs a result, the 15 Eurobonds have been exchanged for five new bonds and distribution to eligible holders was completed on 10 October 2024. The assignment of a 'CCC+' rating to these five bonds reflects our assessment of Ghana's expected credit profile after completion of the whole debt restructuring, with a declining debt supported by ongoing fiscal consolidation, and elevated liquidity risks with interest spending relative to revenue which is still high.\n\nSignificant Reduction in Terms: In exchange for the 15 outstanding Eurobonds with a total face value of USD13.1 billion, investors were offered a set of new bonds, with two options. Under the 'disco' option, a nominal haircut of 37% applies on all claims, which then is restructured into two new notes - a step-up coupon amortising notes due 2029 and a step-up coupon amortising note due 2035. The step-up coupon rates range from 5% to 6%.\n\nUnder the 'par' option there is no nominal haircut, but claims are restructured to a 1.5% amortising note due 2037. Both the 'disco' option and 'par' option receive a zero-coupon amortising note due 2026 and a zero-coupon note due 2030 in exchange of past-due interests. The restructuring does not provide for value-recovery instruments. Tenders representing a total of USD994.8 million opted for the par option (below the cap of USD1.6 billion).\n\nSubstantial Debt Relief: The Eurobond exchange entails a reduction in Ghana's FC debt stock (including PDIs) of around 6% of estimated 2024 GDP. FC debt service is reduced by USD3.5 billion over 2024-2026. Interest payments are reduced by 1.3% of GDP in 2024, 0.9% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026 compared with interest payments due under the original terms of the bonds. These estimates do not factor in the cost of rolling over bonds (at increased coupon rates, given market conditions) that would have matured in 2023-2026, implying larger actual debt relief.\n\nDeclining Debt: Assuming similar treatment of FC commercial debt that still needs to be restructured, the debt stock reduction would reach 7% of estimated 2024 GDP. This, combined with a strong medium-term growth forecast and ongoing fiscal consolidation, will contribute to a decline in central government's debt, to 70% of GDP in 2024 and 68% in 2025 and 2026, from 77% of GDP in 2023.\n\nOfficial Treatment Adds to Relief: The Eurobond treatment was designed to be comparable in scale (although likely different in terms of parameters of present value reduction, debt-service reduction over the IMF programme period, and duration) to the official sector treatment, for which terms of the June 2024 memorandum of understanding have not been disclosed. Incorporating the official treatment would entail a further reduction of the debt-service burden.\n\nRemaining FC Debt in Default: The affirmation of LTFC IDR at 'RD' reflects Ghana remaining in default on some of its external commercial debt, pending a restructuring. The Eurobond exchange covenants contain a most-favoured creditor clause that restricts the country from restructuring debt with its remaining creditors on more favourable terms (on a present value basis) without offering consideration of equivalent value to noteholders. We estimate Ghana will complete its external debt restructuring by early 2025.",

   "source": "My Joy Online",
   "Content": "Ghana, the world’s second-largest cocoa producer, is at risk of seeing its cocoa export earnings crash below the $2 billion mark in 2024—the lowest since 2010.\n\nDespite strong cocoa futures due to supply restrictions during the 2023/2024 season, analysis of Bank of Ghana data by the JoyNews Research Desk reveals that the country’s once-reliable cocoa industry, a backbone of its economy, is on track to bring in its weakest export earnings in over a decade.\n\nGhana’s cocoa revenues, which peaked at $2.87 billion in 2011, have fallen steadily to $2.12 billion in 2023, representing a cumulative 26% decline. This translates to an average annual drop of 2% over the last decade.\n\nWith projected 2024 cocoa export earnings expected to dip below the critical $2 billion threshold, the ongoing decline is anticipated to put further pressure on the Ghanaian cedi, worsening the country’s fiscal challenges.\n\nSeveral factors are crippling Ghana’s cocoa production, including illegal mining (galamsey), erratic weather patterns, crop diseases, and rampant smuggling.\n\nThese issues have severely undermined the nation’s ability to capitalize on rising global cocoa prices, making it difficult to secure favorable cocoa-syndicated loans, a critical source of foreign exchange that has historically helped stabilize the cedi.\n\nComparative analysis of earnings as of August 2024 suggests that reaching $2 billion by the end of the fiscal year will be challenging. By August, cocoa export earnings stood at just $917.8 million, marking the lowest in six years for the same period.\n\nThis is a sharp drop from the $1.7 billion average for the first eight months of the year since 2019. In fact, the current cumulative inflows from cocoa exports are $782 million below the five-year average and 43% lower than what was recorded in the same period in 2023, signaling a deepening crisis in the sector.",

   "source": "Kenyan Wall Street",
   "Content": "Banking sector has raised alarm over pending bills and overegulation as key threats to Kenya’s Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector.\n\n- According to the chairman of Kenya Bankers Association John Gachora, the sector which currently contributes one third of Kenya’s GDP is overregulated with 60 per cent of enterpreneurs feeling overwhelmed by compliance requirements hindering ability to innovate and expand.\n\n- The sector is also estimated to be owed Sh70 billion in pending bills impacting businesses viability, supply chain and making MSMEs less attractive for lending.\n\n- The banks also endorsed planned transition of the Credit Guarantee Scheme to a private limited company with government being minority shareholders.\n\nAs at June, 2024, the scheme had over 4000 beneficiaries across 46 counties with Sh6.29 billion disbursed.\n\n“If there is a way to prioritise MSMes who are owed these small amounts by the government, it will go a long way in unlocking the challenges faced and make the sector flourish,” Gachora noted also calling on the government to streamline some of its regulations burdening the sector.\n\nSpeaking during the 2024 Kenya Bankers Association (KBA) Inua Biashara Exhibition in Nairobi, Gachora said the banking industry has set aside Ksh150 billion each year over the next three years for lending to MSMEs to address access to finance challenges faced by the sector.\n\nGachora noted that the model has proved effective in other markets and could be borrowed locally to bring out the full potential of MSMes.\n\n“I commend the banking industry’s pledge to double lending to MSMEs by providing KSh150 billion in new loans annually, beginning in 2025. Accordingly, the government will support this bold and innovative move through policy and institutional backing, including measures to guarantee the prompt payment of all pending government bills, which will commence once the ongoing verification process is completed,” said President William Ruto\n\n“Finally, I urge the National Treasury and the Ministry of Cooperatives & MSME Development to align policies in order to provide a sustainable framework for engaging with opportunities for transformation and addressing the challenges MSMEs face in accessing credit. This will help foster the broadest inclusion of stakeholders in the financial services sector,” he added.\n\nThe 2024 Inua Biashara MSME Exhibition, hosted by the Kenya Bankers Association (KBA) brings together business owners, financial institutions, and government leaders to focus on empowering MSMEs through tailored financial solutions.\n\nThe exhibition provides an opportunity for MSMEs to engage directly with banks and access critical financial products designed to meet their needs.",

   "Content": "Satellite data subscription grew by 1,955.3% after the licensing and launch of Starlink Internet Services Kenya in July 2023, a new report by the Communications Authority (CA) shows.\n\n- Starlink, operated by American aerospace company SpaceX and owned by Elon Musk announced entry into the Kenyan market mid-last year.\n\n- It offers a satellite internet service that uses a constellation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites.\n\n- Starlink now has a 0.5% market share in fixed data subscriptions.\n\nUnlike traditional satellite internet, Starlink provides high-speed, low latency connectivity, supporting services not possible with traditional satellite technology.\n\nAccording to the fourth quarter industry statistics by the CA, satellite data Subscribers stood at 8,324 by June compared to 4,808 in March this year. By June last year, the number of satellite subscribers was only 405.\n\n“Satellite subscriptions maintained an upward trend following the launch of Starlink services during the year, with 96.9 per cent of satellite customers subscribed to speeds between 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps,” noted CA.\n\nMarket Share\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Safaricom PLC has the largest market share of 36.4 percent followed by Jamii Telecommunications Ltd and Wananchi Group at 24.0 and 17.5 percent respectively. Poa Internet, Mawingu, Vilcom, Dimension Data and Liquid Telecommunications Kenya command 13.2 per cent, 2.6 per cent, 1.5 per cent, 1.1 per cent, 1 per cent respectively.\n\nBoth Vijiji Connect and Starlink Internet Services Kenya control 0.5 per cent of market share. The total lit international internet Bandwidth Capacity in the country grew by 2.4 percent to 21,244.338 Gbps by end of June 2024.\n\nSEACOM Ltd lit additional capacity during the quarter with the aim of meeting increasing customer demands. Utilization of Undersea Bandwidth Capacity rose by 31.3 to record 14,644.284 Gbps out of which 11,690.464 Gbps (55.0 per cent) were used in the country and 2,953.820 Gbps (13.9 per cent) sold outside the country.\n\nFurther, utilized Satellite Internet Capacity increased remarkably from 48.438 to 840.448 Gbps (1,635.1% increase) following the launch of Starlink Internet services in the country.\n\nSafaricom Sues for Peace\n\nIn late September, market leader Safaricom confirmed it is in talks with Starlink and other satellite companies, as Elon Musk’s global project puts pressure on traditional telcos. Read More.\n\nAt the time, CEO Peter Ndegwa told Bloomberg TV that the telco has “to partner with Starlink or other satellite providers in future to make sure that that technology plays right through.”\n\nSafaricom had initially claimed that Starlink’s operation could weaken regulatory oversight due its cross-border service. The decision to re-engage with Starlink shows that both sides have decided to be pragmatic. Musk’s focus has been on building the hardware, and partnering with local firms for distribution. \n\nElon Musk Internet Company Starlink Enters Kenya, Heightening Competition – Kenyan Wall Street – Business, Markets & Finance Insights",

   "source": "My Joy Online",
   "Content": "The issuance of mining and mining-related licenses in Ghana has garnered significant attention, reflecting the country's rich mineral potential and concerns over regulatory practices and illegal mining activities, known locally as ‘galamsey’.\n\nThere has been a growing tension regarding the number of mining and mining-related licenses that successive governments have released over the years.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of data from the Ghana Mining Repository.\n\nHow many licenses have been issued so far?\n\nAccording to data from the Ghana Mining repository, 2,250 mining and mining-related licenses have been issued from 1988 to a starting period in 2025.\n\nPeriod Analysis\n\nThe period analysis is divided into three periods: 1988 to 2008, 2009 to 2016, and 2017 to 2025. The inclusion of 2025 is due to the presence of one license stated to begin in 2025.\n\nIllegal small-scale mining also known as 'galamsey'\nFrom 1988 to 2008, 40 mining and mining-related licenses were issued.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2016, 59 licenses were issued, and between 2017 to date, 2,151 mining and mining-related licenses have been issued.\n\nWhat is the current status of these Licenses?\n\nThe data from the mining repository shows that 2,202 of the total licenses are currently active and operational, 18 of them have been suspended, 29 are under review and 1 license is on a pending notice.\n\nWhat is the highest number of licenses issued in a single year?\n\nThe highest number of mining and mining-related licenses that were issued in a single year is 824.\n\nThis was in 2020 under the current government. It is followed by 614 licenses issued in 2024 (Jan-date). Both figures fall in general election years under the current government.   \n\nThe trend, however, shows a more increasing rate of mining and mining-related license issuance in the past 6 years as the period has more peaks.\n\nWhat is the highest number of licenses issued in a day?\n\nThe most notable peak occurred on January 1, 2024, when 330 licenses were issued in a single day.\n\nThis figure surpasses the total number of licenses issued over the entire 28-year period from 1988 to 2016, indicating a significant shift in the pace and scale of licensing activities.",

   "Content": "The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has authorized JPMorgan Chase Bank, the largest bank in the US, to establish a regional representative office in Nairobi, Kenya, just days before CEO Jamie Dimon’s visit to the city.\n\n- The JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. Representative Office Kenya targets large multinationals that are not well-served by local investment banking firms due to a lack of expertise to handle large transactions.\n\n- JPMorgan Chase decided to set up a regional office in Nairobi after the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, announced in 2018 that the bank had hired a special team of bankers to help coordinate and expand the bank’s relationships in Kenya and Ghana.\n\n- The authorization comes after 6 years of delays despite the office’s inauguration ahead of the CEO’s visit this month.\n\nA representative office is mandated to sign deals on behalf of its parent company but shielded from collecting deposits from the public.\n\n- “Under the Banking Act, Representative Offices of foreign banks in Kenya serve as marketing and liaison offices for their parent banks and affiliates and are not permitted to undertake banking business.”\n\nThe new regional office in Nairobi will serve as a hub for J.P. Morgan’s operations in East Africa, with the bank stating its intention to serve the country, all US multinationals going in, the wealth funds, and universities. The move is part of J.P. Morgan’s strategy to expand its services globally. The bank already has offices in South Africa and Nigeria.\n\nJPMorgan’s move into Kenya is seen as a significant boost to the country’s economy and its efforts to position itself as a hub for finance and investment in East Africa. The bank’s decision to open a regional office in Nairobi is expected to create job opportunities and attract more foreign investment to the country.\n\n“The JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A Representative Office Kenya will contribute to the diversity of Kenya’s financial sector and catalyze trade and investments. Additionally, the authorization of the Representative Office affirms Kenya’s standing as a premier financial services hub,” CBK noted in a statement,”",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "The Lagos state government has committed to paying a minimum wage of N85,000 to civil servants- higher than the federal government’s approved minimum wage of N70,000.\n\nMr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos state Governor stated this in an interview on Channels Television where he talked about his government’s plans for the state and effort to address problems.\n\nThe Governor explained the increase in the state’s minimum wage beyond the federal government’s approved amount is a matter of affordability and capacity and in response to the significantly high cost of living in Lagos state.\n \nFurthermore, the Governor noted that it would be his pleasure to announce another increase in minimum wage if possible, in January of next year.\n\nHe said, “You also mentioned about the minimum wage and what do I need to throw in for my people. I’m glad to announce that the minimum wage for Lagos which we have discussed with our unions is N85,000 today and it is not a competition. It is a function of affordability and capacity but we know too well that when people live in Lagos, it has a premium in terms of cost of living.”  \n\n“We increased our salary earlier in the year and would like to come in January and say I’ve been able to increase the minimum wage in Lagos to N100,000.”  \n\nFurthermore, the Governor spoke on the state’s plan for the transport sector with respect to rail transport. According to him, the state government plans to connect all five districts to rail transport.\n\nWhat you should know\n\nIn July, President Tinubu approved a new minimum wage of N70,000 for Nigerian workers, with a pledge to review the national minimum wage law every three years.\n\n- The announcement was made during a meeting with leaders of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) at the presidential villa in Abuja. Among those in attendance were NLC President Joe Ajaero, TUC President Festus Osifo, and key federal ministers.\n\n- The new minimum wage was necessitated by the severe cost of living crisis being witnessed by Nigerians following the removal of the petrol subsidy and devaluation of the Naira. The inflation rate in the country rose for 19 consecutive months reaching a 28-year of 34.19% in June 2024 with food inflation crossing 40%.\n\n- President Tinubu had promised that ongoing reforms in the energy and foreign exchange sectors were needed to avert a collapse of the economy and that future generations would reap the benefits.",

   "source": "Ghana Web",
   "Content": "The World Bank's October 2024 Africa Pulse Report has revealed that the cedi and three other currencies are the worst-performing in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in 2024.\n\nAccording to the report, the cedi has lost about 24% of its value against the US dollar, making it the fourth weakest currency in SSA.\n\nThe three other currencies are South Sudan’s pound (over 60% depreciation), Ethiopia's birr (51%), and Nigeria’s naira (over 40%).\n\n“Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria are among the worst-performing countries in Africa this year, and their currencies continue weakening while demand for foreign exchange remains pressing,” the report stated.\n\nIt added, “By the end of August 2024, the Ethiopian birr, Nigerian naira, and South Sudanese pound were among the worst performers in the region. The Nigerian naira continued losing value, with a year-to-date depreciation of about 43% as of the end of August.\"\n\nThe report attributed the weakening of the naira to surges in demand for US dollars in the parallel market, driven by financial institutions, money managers, and non-financial end-users. This, combined with limited dollar inflows and slow foreign exchange disbursements to currency exchange bureaus by the central bank, exacerbated the naira's depreciation.\n\nConversely, the Kenyan shilling is the best-performing currency in Africa this year, with a year-to-date gain of about 21% as of August 2024.\n\n“The Kenyan shilling is the best-performing currency in Sub-Saharan Africa this year, appreciating by 21% year-to-date by the end of August 2024. The South African rand and currencies pegged to it have strengthened by 3.1% so far this year, after losing value last year.”\n\nThe report also noted that some currencies that weakened in 2023 have stabilized and gained strength in 2024.\n\n“From a sample of 30 countries and two currency unions (the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa and WAEMU), more than one-third of the countries in the region are set to have less than three months of imports in international reserves by the end of 2024,” the report added.",

   "Content": "Nigeria’s headline inflation rate in September 2024 rose to 32.70%, up from 32.15% in August 2024, marking a 0.55% increase month-on-month.  \n\nThis is according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) report which stated that inflation during the month was propelled by increases in transportation costs and food prices.\n\nThis is coming on the heels of increases in petrol prices by the NNPCL since early September. \n\nOn a year-on-year basis, the rate was 5.98 percentage points higher than the 26.72% recorded in September 2023, indicating a significant increase in inflation over the past year. \n\nAdditionally, on a month-on-month basis, the headline inflation rate in September 2024 was 2.52%, 0.30% higher than the 2.22% recorded in August 2024. This indicates that the average price level increased at a faster rate in September compared to August 2024. \n\nFood Inflation\n\nThe food inflation rate in September 2024 was 37.77% year-on-year, marking an increase of 7.13 percentage points from the 30.64% recorded in September 2023.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the food inflation rate in September 2024 stood at 2.64%, reflecting a 0.27% rise compared to the 2.37% recorded in August 2024.\n\nThis increase can be linked to the rising prices of items such as beer (local and foreign) in the tobacco class, vegetable oil, groundnut oil, and palm oil in the oil and fats class, as well as beef, gizzard, dried beef in the meat class, and products like Lipton, Milo, and Bournvita.\n\nThe average annual food inflation rate for the twelve months ending in September 2024 was 37.53%, a 11.88 percentage point increase from the 25.65% recorded in September 2023.\n\nCore Inflation\n\nCore inflation, which excludes volatile agricultural products and energy prices, stood at 27.43% year-on-year in September 2024, an increase of 5.59 percentage points compared to 21.84% in September 2023.\n\nThe largest price increases were seen in items such as rent (actual and imputed rentals for housing), intercity bus journeys, taxi fares (under passenger transport by road), meals at local restaurants (accommodation services), and others.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the core inflation rate was 2.10% in September 2024, down by 0.17% from the 2.27% recorded in August 2024.\n\nRural and Urban inflation in September\n\nThe urban inflation rate in September 2024 was 2.67%, reflecting a 0.28 percentage point increase compared to 2.39% in August 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, the rural inflation rate stood at 2.39% in September 2024, up by 0.33 percentage points from 2.06% recorded in August 2024.",

The adoption of ISO 20022 introduces a more standardized and structured method of data exchange, which is set to further improve efficiency and reduce risks in financial transactions both locally and internationally.\n\nThe migration aligns Kenya with global financial trends and is expected to contribute to more secure and faster payments, improving the country’s integration into the global financial system.\n\n“The migration of KEPSS to ISO20022 brings significant benefits, including faster settlement times, streamlined processing, and improved liquidity management for financial institutions. The Standard’s rich data formats will aid in monitoring fraud and improve the detection and prevention of illicit transactions,” CBK said in a statement.\n\n“Additionally, the standardisation provided by ISO20022 reduces the complexity of payments and significantly enhances efficiency. The ISO20022 Standard will enhance interoperability between domestic and international payment systems, facilitating easier cross-border transactions and increase the ease of doing business globally. Overall, these benefits will enhance the convenience, speed and security of payments for corporates and customers alike.”\n\nBetween August last year and this year, KEPSS processed over 5.3 million transactions valued at over Sh45 trillion for local currency transactions.\n\n“CBK has directed banks to inform their customers and provide necessary support to ensure seamless service. CBK is committed to continuous improvement and renewal of Kenya’s payments infrastructure to meet the evolving needs of the economy and support the country’s vision of becoming a global financial hub.”",

   "Content": "Wale Edun, the minister of Finance, has stated that Nigeria’s revenue recorded increase in the 2024 fiscal year so far is being channelled into social intervention programmes.\n\nPresident Bola Ahmed Tinubu recently announced that the federal government’s revenue for the first half of 2024 (January to June) stood at over N9.1 trillion—more than double the N4.06 trillion generated in the same period in 2023.\n\nSpeaking at a panel session titled ‘Fiscal Reforms for a More Secure Future’ during the 30th Nigeria Economic Summit in Abuja on Tuesday, Edun said the increased revenue is primarily being used to finance social programmes aimed at mitigating the impact of essential but challenging reforms that have affected the cost of living.\n\nAccording to him, the interventions include direct cash transfers targeting 20 million households, with 4 million households already reached.\n\nEdun also highlighted other initiatives, such as the student loan scheme and consumer credit made available to workers to enable them to purchase household goods or convert their vehicles to cheaper, cleaner Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) fuel.\n\nIn the agricultural sector, the government is providing grants and loans worth up to N75 billion to support one million small and micro enterprises.\n\nFor larger companies, Edun said an additional N75 billion is being disbursed in tranches of N1 billion per company at a 9 percent annual interest rate, helping them manage the cost of production and operations, particularly in light of the recent foreign exchange adjustments impacting their profit margins.\n\n“This is how President Tinubu and his government are spending the increased revenue, which has been driven by improved oil production and macroeconomic reforms that are expected to save the country 5 percent of GDP,” Edun explained.\n\n“There is a broad array of social investment initiatives where these funds are being directed.”\n\nAlso speaking at the summit, Ndiamé Diop, the World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, acknowledged the country’s significant revenue increase, noting that its revenue-to-GDP ratio is expected to improve.\n\nHe pointed out that in 2022, Nigeria spent 12.9 percent of its GDP, but revenue covered only 7.6 percent, leaving the country with a substantial fiscal deficit funded mainly through debt. “This trajectory could have led to a crisis,” Diop warned.\n\nThe ongoing reforms, he suggested, are essential to stabilising Nigeria’s fiscal position and ensuring sustainable economic growth.",

   "source": "BusinessDay",
   "Content": "Nigeria’s persistent battle with inflation has reignited, with headline inflation to 32.70 percent in September on petrol price hike, marking a sharp reversal from the two-month decline witnessed earlier.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, Consumer’s Price Index increased to 32.70 percent in September 2024 from 32.15 percent in August 2024.\n\nIn the same vein month-on-month inflation rate for September 2024 went up 0.30 percent to 2.52 percent, from percent recorded in August 2024.\n\nNigeria’s annual headline inflation dipped in July for the first time in 19 months to 33.40 percent and further down to 32.15 percent in August. Creating the closest gap between the interest rate and inflation this year.\n\nThe increase in consumer price index is despite the Monetary Policy Committee 50 basis point hike in interest rate to 27.25 percent, the fifth consecutive hike this year to battle Nigeria’s sticky inflation.\n\nIn September, Nigerians experienced an upward review of PMS prices from N597.00 to N855.00. Last week NNPC increased petrol prices from N950/Liter to N998/Liter in Lagos and as high as N1,003 in northeastern states, the second increment in two months as petrol price deregulation takes full effect.\n\nAnalysts at Financial Derivatives Company Limited, an economic think tank had projected that headline inflation will increase marginally by 0.22 percent to 32.37 percent on the back of the new petrol price, coupled with exchange rate volatility and floods in northern Nigeria, which will undermine agricultural production .\n\nFood inflation, a significant driver of overall inflation, rose to 37.7 percent in September, from 30.64 percent in September 2023.\n\nEggs have become inaccessible for several Nigerian homes who cannot afford to pay N6000 to purchase a crate of the poultry products.\n\nThe average price of a crate of eggs has hit N6, 000 in various parts of Nigeria, from less than N3000 per crate 12-15 months ago.\n\nAlready strained Nigerians disposable income has been put under fresh pressure as the price of transportation and other commodities skyrockets off the increment.\n\nThe major driver of the rising price is the skyrocketing cost of inputs, particularly feed, maize and soybeans. High petrol prices have also been blamed for the price jump.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes volatile agricultural produce and energy prices, rose to 27.43 percent in September 2024, from 21.84 percent in September 2023.Indermit Gill, senior vice president World Bank Group, said at the 30th National Economic Summit on Monday that to protect the poor and maintain competitiveness, the central bank must stay focused on inflation.\n\n“It should resist the lure of short-term capital inflows that might push up the Naira’s value too quickly and crimp non-oil growth. It should rebuild foreign exchange reserves instead as a cushion against oil price volatility,” Gill said.\n\nThe second thing is to help every vulnerable household cope with still higher inflation. The government is rolling out a large-scale targeted temporary cash transfer program that has already reached between four and five million households.",

One-third of the funding will be dedicated to beneficiaries in the agricultural value chain.\n\n“We are scaling our interventions to build a strong and vibrant SME sector to provide a solid foundation for lifting communities. We are increasingly addressing the barriers that hinder SME growth, and this funding will provide tailored financial solutions, business mentorship, and capacity-building initiatives to ensure that SMEs not only survive but thrive in the dynamic marketplace,” KCB Group Chief Executive Officer Paul Russo said on Thursday.\n\nThe Gates Foundation will provide technical assistance for the project and address a range of issues that limit women with low incomes from accessing finance - such as lack of collateral or credit history. This will help to cut the cost of loans to women through digital technology and risk sharing.\n\n“Micro, small, and medium-sized businesses are the economic lifeblood of Kenya but are more vulnerable to crises than larger enterprises. The lack of adequate, affordable financing puts significant pressure on private lending, disadvantaging entrepreneurs and small companies. We believe this new partnership will help spur private sector growth, gender equality, youth empowerment, sustainable job creation, and poverty reduction,” EIB Vice President Thomas Östros said.\n\nThis funding is part of the Investing in Young Businesses in Africa (IYBA) initiative, which is supported by several EU Member States and their financial institutions.\n\nIYBA provides not only capital for start-ups and early-stage businesses but also technical assistance and capacity building to ensure the sustainability and bankability of these businesses, thereby promoting long-term job creation.\n\nKCB Bank Kenya already has a women-focused programme called Female-Led and Made Enterprises (FLME), which allocates Sh50 billion annually to support women entrepreneurs. This initiative is part of KCB’s broader strategy to support youth development and SME growth in Kenya.",

   "Url": "https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/BoG-Gold-Coins-Investment-A-safe-haven-or-another-risky-gamble-1955930",
   "source": "Ghana Web",
   "Content": "Ghana’s financial landscape has changed significantly over the years, with both lucrative investment opportunities and devastating financial losses. For many people, investing is more than just a way to increase their wealth; it’s also a way to secure their future and protect their hard-earned money.\n\nHowever, previous experiences, particularly the failure of fraudulent schemes such as Menzgold, have made many Ghanaians skeptical of new investment opportunities.\n\nThe Bank of Ghana (BoG) recently launched a gold coin investment initiative, positioning it as a stable and secure option for those seeking to diversify their portfolios. This move aims to influence the demand for foreign currencies, particularly the U.S dollar, as a store of value which could ease some pressure on the cedi in the forex market.\n\nGold has traditionally been regarded as a dependable store of value, particularly during periods of currency rate instability and economic volatilities. For centuries, it has represented wealth and security, attracting both individual and institutional investors.\n\nThe BoG’s gold coin initiative taps into this sentiment by allowing Ghanaians to invest in physical gold. However, the question remains: Is this investment truly a safe haven, or is it another risky gamble, similar to previous schemes that left many financially disabled?\n\nIn response to this important question, this article, as is typical of me, provides a thorough examination of the BoG’s gold coin initiative, drawing lessons from previous schemes such as Menzgold and DKM Financial Services.\n\nIt provides a comparison of BoG gold coin investments to what is known in the past to assist investors in weighing the potential risks and rewards of this new investment opportunity. Ghanaians can make better financial decisions if they understand the difference between legitimate, regulated opportunities and speculative schemes.\n\nWhat is the problem?\n\nIn recent years, Ghanaians have witnessed a surge in various investment schemes, with some offering tantalizing returns while others collapsing, leaving investors in despair. One notable example is the defunct Menzgold investment scheme, which promised extraordinary returns on gold-backed investments, attracting top-tier professionals and financial experts but ended in turmoil, resulting in significant losses for many investors.\n\nNow, with the Bank of Ghana’s (BoG) initiative to introduce a gold coin, announced on September 27th, 2024 by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the key question arises: Is gold coin investment a truly secure financial refuge for Ghanaians seeking stability, or does it represent a risky gamble that requires careful consideration and risk management?\n\nAddressing this question is critical for assisting potential investors in making informed decisions, especially in light of inflationary pressures, sky-rocketing desire to hold dollars as a store of value, the continuous depreciation of the Ghanaian currency, and previous experiences with failed gold-related schemes such as Menzgold. Can BoG succeed with the gold-coin strategic investment initiative?\n\nUnderstanding the BoG’s Gold Coin Investment\n\nThe Bank of Ghana’s gold coin initiative is part of its effort to tap into the global demand for gold and provide Ghanaians with a new, reliable investment avenue.\n\nGold has long been viewed as a “safe haven” investment, especially during economic downturns and periods of currency instability. In many parts of the world, gold investments offer stability and protection against inflation, making them a popular choice for both individuals and institutions.\n\nHowever, unlike Menzgold’s promises of high returns, the BoG’s gold coin investment seems to be structured differently. It is rooted in more conventional practices, with no inflated promises of exponential profits. The BoG, as a central financial institution, also offers a level of regulatory oversight and transparency, providing reassurance to cautious investors.\n\nLessons from Menzgold: High Returns, High Risk>\n\nTo many Ghanaians, Menzgold’s collapse serves as a painful reminder of what can happen when investments lack regulatory oversight and when returns seem “too good to be true.” Menzgold attracted a broad section of the population with its aggressive marketing and promises of gold-backed returns. However, the company’s operations fell outside the scope of Ghana’s financial regulatory framework, leading to concerns about the legitimacy and safety of investors’ funds.\n\nEventually, the government’s interventions and investigations revealed that Menzgold was operating illegally. Investors faced devastating losses, many of whom had invested their life savings, expecting high returns with minimal risk. This created skepticism about gold-related investments, even in a nation rich in the precious metal.\n\nLessons from DKM Financial Services: Trusting Unregulated Institutions\n\nBefore the Menzgold collapse, the DKM Financial Services crisis of 2015 shocked the nation. DKM was a microfinance institution that offered unusually high interest rates on deposits, promising significant returns on investments. Many Ghanaians, particularly in rural areas, flocked to DKM, hoping to benefit from the attractive interest rates. However, much like Menzgold, DKM’s promises were too good to be true.\n\nDKM’s operations were riddled with poor financial management and lacked regulatory compliance. The institution was not adequately supervised by the Bank of Ghana, and its business model was unsustainable, relying heavily on attracting new deposits to pay off existing investors. When the BoG intervened and froze DKM’s assets, the company collapsed, leaving many investors devastated and unable to recover their funds.\n\nThe DKM crisis teaches us the importance of regulatory oversight and the need to trust only legitimate, well-regulated financial institutions. Without the proper checks and balances, even seemingly successful businesses can fall apart, leading to significant financial losses for unsuspecting investors. Trusting an unregulated entity can be a risky gamble, one that can leave investors with no recourse when things go wrong.\n\nComparing BoG’s Gold Coin Initiative to Past Failures\n\nThe Bank of Ghana’s gold coin initiative differs significantly from schemes like Menzgold and DKM. Unlike those schemes, BoG’s gold coins are introduced under a legal and regulatory framework, providing a level of transparency and security that was absent in previous cases. The central bank, as the country’s leading financial institution, operates with the mandate of ensuring economic stability and protecting investors’ interests.\n\nThis is a far cry from the opaque and unsustainable practices of Menzgold and DKM. Furthermore, BoG’s gold coin initiative does not promise extraordinary returns or get-rich-quick opportunities. Instead, it is presented as a long-term store of value, capitalizing on gold’s historical role as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. The gold coins are designed for investors looking for a safe, stable investment, not for those seeking rapid wealth accumulation through speculative means.\n\nThe Risks and Considerations\n\nWhile the BoG gold coin investment may be safer, it does not mean it is without risks. As with all investments, there are external factors that can impact its value. For example, gold prices are influenced by global market dynamics, inflation, and interest rates.\n\nOther factors that needs to be considered before- hand, includes but not limited to issues relating to tax implications, storage cost, buy-backs(liquidity), time-horizons, geopolitical risk dynamics, and transactional cost. Perhaps, these are concerning factors that BoG is yet to clarify to potential gold-coin-investors. Gold has traditionally held its value over time, however short-term fluctuations can lead to losses for investors looking for quick returns.\n\nMoreover, there is the psychological challenge for many investors in Ghana. With the scars left by Menzgold, some may still feel uneasy about investing in anything gold-related. Even with a reputable institution like the BoG leading the charge, winning back trust will be a gradual process.\n\nConclusion: Learning from the Past to Secure the Future\n\nThe introduction of the BoG’s gold coin initiative represents a promising opportunity for Ghanaians to invest in a safe and regulated product. However, is good to note the lessons from Menzgold and DKM Financial Services risks of pursuing high returns without proper oversight and regulation. Individuals who invest in BoG gold coins can benefit from gold’s historical stability while avoiding the pitfalls of speculative, high-risk ventures.\n\nFinally, understanding the risks, conducting proper due diligence, asking the right questions, and placing trust in regulated, transparent financial institutions are essential for making informed investment decisions.\n\nWhile no investment is without risk, the BoG’s gold coin initiative provides a far safer alternative to previous disastrous schemes. Learning from previous failures allows Ghanaians to approach this new opportunity with caution and confidence, ensuring a more secure financial future.",

   "source": "Proshare",
   "Content": "The 2024 Proshare Bank Strength Index (PBSI), which used the FY 2023 results of banks, identified Access Corp, Zenith, FBNH, ETI, UBA, and GTCO, the so-called FUGAZE, as tier-one banks.  Proshare analysts observed that banks were pursuing increasingly aggressive approaches to acquiring digital market share while supporting lower operating costs (lower cost-to-income ratios (CIRs)), which showed up in the 2023 PBSI, where Access Corp ranked highest amongst its tier 1 counterparts. Still, GTCO fell a few notches because of relative weakness in key indicators such as asset size and growth. Contextually, the PBSI is a multi-dimensional index that evaluates banks' strength based on key financial and non-financial metrics such as asset quality, risk management, efficiency, and governance. \n\n \n\nSimilar to the FY 2023, the H1 2024 PBSI ranking shows a strong performance among Tier 1 banks, with Access Corp maintaining its lead, followed by Zenith, ETI, and FBNH. Unlike the FY 2023, where FBNH ranked third, it dropped a notch to fourth place while ETI climbed from fourth to third, while others maintained their ranking. Access and Zenith Banks' dominance was driven by their capital base, asset quality, risk management, and strong earnings. At the rear of the Tier 1 spectrum, UBA and GTCO showed efficiency and governance strength. However, they fell short in asset size, loan quality, and capitalisation, which weighed down their overall rankings.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThe progress from FY 2023 to H1 2024  underscores the efforts of these banks to adapt to economic changes, particularly regulatory adjustments and revisions, ongoing recapitalisation exercises, and FX fluctuations. If the H1 2024 truly preempts the FY 2024 ranking, the critical factors for sustaining Tier 1 status will remain, solid risk-adjusted capital ratios and enhanced efficiency through lower cost-to-income ratios (CIRs). As digital channels become even more central to banking operations, the capacity to increase digital income will also distinguish leading banks. Sound governance framework, including board composition and diversity, will also continue to play a pivotal role in determining the resilience and adaptability of these institutions in a fast-evolving financial landscape like Nigeria’s.\n\n\nAccess Corp\n\nAccess Corp's inorganic expansion model fast-tracked its growth, becoming the Nigerian banking industry’s asset size, deposits, and loan book leader. The total assets surpassed N30trn in H1 2024, settling at N36.60trn, while deposits and its loan book climbed to N27.35trn and N12.28trn in H1 2024, respectively. Leveraging the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN’s) aggressive monetary tightening and currency depreciation, the group saw half-year 2024 gross earnings rise to N2.20trn, near its full-year 2023 gross earnings of N2.59trn. The larger gross earnings cushioned its higher operating costs and allowed a triple-digit growth in pre-tax profit to N348.92bn in H1 2024. The positive numbers spread to some financial ratios, such as ROE, ROA, NIM, NPL, and CIR, but other ratios, such as cost of risk and cost of the fund, had adverse outcomes. \n\n\n\nFollowing the CBN’s directive on recapitalisation, the Holdco has started its capital-raising, offering 17.772bn ordinary shares of 50kobo to existing shareholders at N19.75k to raise N351bn.  Reports suggested the issuance was oversubscribed, and the N351bn raised will close the group’s capital gap. \n\n \n\nFBN Holdings\n\nFBNH saw its gross earnings rise by 118.76% to N1.40trn, and pre-tax earnings rose to N411.99bn in H1 2024. Its H1 performance was driven mainly by net interest income (NII) and net fair value gains on FVTPL, which absorbed shocks from a foreign exchange revaluation loss of N165.05bn in H1 2024 (from 98.14bn in H1 2023) and rising operating expenses of N445.70bn. The HoldCo’s revaluation loss exempts it from the Finance Ministry’s 70% windfall tax.\n\n \n\nFBNH’s current Tier 1 capital of N251.00bn shows a capital gap of N249bn to retain its international license. On April 30, 2024, the Holdco disclosed its plans to meet its capital gap by raising N300bn through a blend of Rights Issue, Private Placement and IPO. Additionally, FBNH announced a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) to divest its 100% equity stake in its wholly-owned subsidiary, FBNQuest Merchant Bank Limited. \n\n \n\nUnited Bank for Africa\n\nUBA’s half-year 2024 gross earnings climbed to N1.37trn, but larger interest, other operating expenses, and hyperinflation monetary loss pinched profit. The Profit before tax fell by -0.15%, and the profit after tax saw a larger decline of -16.36% due to a +235.34% rise in income tax expense. This mildly affected most of the group’s financial ratios, leading to lower return on assets (ROA) and equity (ROE), higher CIR, cost of funds, cost of risk, in addition to rising nonperforming loans (NPLs). The UBA group has not announced a capital raise programme to fill its N385bn tier 1 capital gap. \n\n \n\nEcobank Transnational Incorporated\n\nThe banking group’s continental structure has strengthened its ability to absorb adverse risks across subsidiaries and generate solid financial performances. Therefore, ETI saw top-line and bottom-line earnings grow by triple digits to N1.86trn and N311.02bn, driven by continental monetary tightening and cross-continental currency depreciations. The Holdco had larger foreign revaluation gains and interest income from Anglophone West Africa (AWA), Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa (CESA), and Francophone West Africa (UEMOA), which offset the relatively weak performance of the Nigerian subsidiary. \n\n \n\nETI has yet to issue any information about the recapitalisation of its Nigerian subsidiary. The Nigerian subsidiary holds a national license and is expected to have a tier 1 capital base of N200bn by 2026.\n\n \n\nZenith Bank\n\nZenith Bank’s increased off-balance-sheet transactions complemented its income from its core lending operations to generate a positive H1 2024 result. The group’s earnings grew to N2.10trn in H12024, above its industry average earnings, leveraging a 176.45% increase in interest earnings due to increasing MPR. This, in turn, drove a 107.51% rise in its profit before tax to N727.03bn and total assets to NN27.58trn in H1 2024. \n\n \n\nThe group began its capital-raise exercise with the announcement of a hybrid offer of 5,232,748,964 shares at N36.00 per share Rights Issue and 2,767,251,036 shares at N36.50k per share Initial Public Offer (IPO), making a total of N260bn in capital raise following the CBN's announcement of the need for industry recapitalisation. The issuance reduces the group’s capital gap to N84.71bn to retain its international license. \n\n \n\nGuaranty Trust Holding Company Plc\n\nGTCO maintained its cost efficiency, generating N1.00trn profit (PBT) from N1.39trn gross earnings in H1 2024. Both interest and non-interest income drove the growth in gross revenues. Regarding financial position, the group’s total assets, loans, and deposits rose to N14.51trn, N3.11trn, and N10.55trn in H1 2024. \n\n \n\nGTCO issued nine billion shares to the public at N44.50 in August to raise N392bn. The combination of the current share capital of N138.19bn and the newly raised N392bn will exceed the new N500bn minimum capital requirement for an international banking license. \n\n \n\nFidelity Bank\n\nFidelity Bank’s gross earnings (N512.86bn) and profit-after-tax (N159.84bn) increased by 107.55% and 157.85%, respectively, driven by higher interest and non-interest income. The positive numbers improved the group’s financial ratios except for NPLR and cost of risk, which increased to 3.50% and 2.10%, respectively. The group’s total assets, loans, and deposits increased to N7.9trn, N3.75trn and N5.38trn, respectively. \n\n \n\nFidelity Bank commenced raising its capital in June, issuing 3.20bn ordinary shares of 50 kobo each to existing shareholders via Rights Issue and ten billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each as IPO to raise N127bn. The issuance was oversubscribed and would reduce the capital gap to N243bn to meet the international banking license requirement. \n\n \n\nFCMB Group Plc\n\nFCMB had a positive 2024 half-year performance, with gross earnings and profitability rising to N374.47bn and N64.21bn. The group had N35.29bn as FX revaluation gain in H1 2024, -30.98% lower than N50.99bn in H1 2024, but the +281.49% increase in net trading income to N31.38bn became a buffer and sustained profitability growth. Total assets grew to N5.95trn in H1 2024.\n\n \n\nThe group issued 15,197,282,219 ordinary shares of 50 kobo each at N7.30 per ordinary share of N0.50K each to raise N110bn. Adding the current capital of N125bn and the newly raised N110bn will reduce its funding gap to N265bn. \n\n \n\nStanbic IBTC Holdings Plc\n\nStanbic IBTC’s Gross earnings grew by 77.44% to N378.55bn in H1 2024, and profit before tax rose to N116.34bn. The gross earnings can be decomposed into 64% interest income and 36% non-interest income. The positive numbers improved the group’s financial ratios, with better NPLR, ROE, ROA, and COR, but CIR and NIM were lowered. The HoldCo’s total assets rose by 18.59% to N6.10bn, with deposits at N2.90trn and loans at N2.17trn in H1 2024. \n\n \n\nStanbic IBTC’s current Tier 1 Capital, at N109.00bn, indicates a funding gap of N91trn. On May 16, 2024, the group announced plans to raise an additional N150bn capital through a right issue.\n\n \n\nSterling Financial Holdings Company Plc\n\nIn H1 2024, Sterling Holdco’s gross earnings rose to N152.20bn, benefitting from higher interest and non-interest income. The higher earnings absorbed the elevated operating expense, generating a 51.39% rise in PBT to N 17.35bn in H1 2024. Similarly, the group’s total assets rose by 31.45% to N3.01trn in H1 2024, driven by a 26.065% rise in loan assets to N1.10trn. Total deposits increased to N2.23trn.\n\nOn September 18, 2024, the group announced a 7.5 billion share right issue of 1 for every four shares held at N4.00k per share, which is still ongoing to raise N30 billion. With a capital of N57.15bn, the group will have a funding gap of N112.85bn to retain its national license.\n\nWema Bank\n\nWema Bank’s broader interest and non-interest income drove gross earnings and profit above their five-year averages, settling at N89.63bn and N26.59bn, respectively. The earnings growth was accompanied by a double-digit increase in total assets, loans and advances and stronger customer penetration at N2.76trn, N973.92bn, and N2.12trn, respectively. The positive income strengthened financial ratios, reflecting improved cost minimisation, better asset quality, and shareholder funds utilisation. \n\n\n\nBased on the recapitalisation exercise, Wema has raised N40bn through a Rights Issue and is expected to raise an additional N150bn through a public offer (IPO) or special placement.",

   "Content": "The yellow metal hit a record high in London trade on Friday, benefiting from safe-haven demand with just weeks left until a closely contested election in the world’s largest economy, alongside the European Central Bank’s interest rate cut to boost spending.\n\nSpot gold increased 40 basis points to a record high of $2,705 (N4.49 million) per ounce, while December gold futures rose by 50 basis points to $2,720 (N4.52 million) in morning trade.\n\nThe naira traded at N1,660.49 per dollar at the official market on Thursday.\n \nThe yellow metal rose even as robust U.S. retail sales and labor market data bolstered expectations that interest rates will decrease more slowly in the coming months.\n\nGold Boosted by Pre-Election Safe-Haven Demand\n\nBullion prices moved out of a narrow trading range seen in the previous two weeks, reaching fresh highs as the United States election approached.\n\nThe precious metal increased by almost 2% for the week after U.S. news on Thursday decreased bets on the extent of Federal Reserve easing.\n\nThis was because demand outweighed other economic headwinds that would typically weigh on the precious metal.\n\nGold is among the best-performing commodities in 2024, with gains of about 30% so far this year. Expectations of rate cuts propelled the most recent rises when the Fed started its cycle of rate reductions last month.\n\nIn the past, significant purchases of gold by central banks have also contributed to rising gold prices.\n\nRecent polls indicate that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will compete in a close presidential election race with less than three weeks until the election.\n\nUncertainty regarding the election’s outcome has increased due to the two candidates’ divergent positions, thereby boosting buying interest in the bullion.\n\nMedia polls indicated that Harris had a modest lead over Trump, while prediction and betting markets strongly suggested that Trump would win.\n\nThe need for gold as a safe haven grew as turmoil in the Middle East continued. After an early October missile attack by Iran, traders were prepared for Israel’s reprisal against Iran.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel would not cease fighting until all of the prisoners abducted by Hamas last year were freed, despite U.S. President Joe Biden’s declaration that the war should end.\n\nIn addition, the ongoing battle between Israel and Hezbollah, which Iran backs, has also prompted retail investors to turn to gold for its relative safety.\n\nOther international economic indicators, like China’s stronger-than-expected 0.9% third-quarter growth, have been overshadowed by geopolitical threats and have had minimal effect on market sentiment. Rather, worries over the stability of the global economy have taken centre stage, which has helped sustain gold’s bullish trend.\n\nGold Ignores the Dollar’s Strength\n\nGold prices remained solid despite pressure from a stronger currency as the greenback hit a two-and-a-half-month high this week.\n\n- A fall in weekly unemployment claims indicated a strong labor market, and the dollar rose in response to stronger-than-expected retail sales figures.\n\n- Important economic indicators on the U.S. front have validated this prediction. September saw a 0.4% gain in retail sales, above the 0.3% estimate, and a decrease in jobless claims to 241,000 from the projected 260,000.\n\n- Furthermore, the business conditions index of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve saw a notable spike in October, rising from 1.7 to 10.3.\n\n- Given the current state of the economy, these findings reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rate cuts in the coming months.\n\nGold and other non-yielding assets are likely to gain strength due to the ECB’s 25 basis point cut, as major central banks worldwide prepare to cut rates.\n\nGold’s Outlook\n\n- Investors in Western markets have increased their buying pressure on gold after mostly avoiding the market during the first half of the year due to the surge in Asian demand.\n\n- The U.S. central bank’s move to a looser monetary policy has increased the popularity of exchange-traded funds backed by bullion.\n\n- For many in the industry, the future looks much brighter from here. By the end of October 2025, prices are projected to rise to about $2,917 an ounce, according to a survey of delegates, traders, refiners, and miners who attended the London Bullion Market Association’s annual meeting this week.",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "The World Bank has said that the recent increase in Nigeria’s minimum wage will only benefit a limited segment of the population, impacting just 4.1% of working-age Nigerians.\n\nAlex Sienaert, the World Bank’s lead economist for Nigeria, shared this during the launch of the Nigeria Development Update (NDU) report in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nSienaert explained that while the wage hike is significant, its direct influence will be minimal, as it primarily affects formal wage earners.\n \n“The Federal Government of Nigeria increased the minimum wage, which will affect only a small share of the population. Raising the minimum wage directly affects only 4.1% of working-age Nigerians,” he said.  \n\nNigeria needs more productive jobs\n\nSienaert emphasized that addressing poverty requires more than employment expansion, stressing the need for productive jobs that provide sustainable livelihoods.\n\nThe new report by the World Bank highlights that employment alone is not a guarantee of escaping poverty, noting, “Being employed, however, is no guarantee of being able to escape poverty. Many jobs are not productive and therefore remunerative enough to afford a life beyond poverty.” \n\nIt added that while creating jobs is essential for inclusive growth, those jobs must harness Nigeria’s growing population and tap into its potential “demographic dividend.”\n\nThe report further highlighted the limited reach of policies focused on formal wage earners, such as public sector workers and minimum wage legislation, noting that these policies often bypass the poorest workers.\n\nIt read: “Policy initiatives that cover only highly-formalized wage jobs – including policies focused on public sector workers and minimum wage legislation – may not reach many of Nigeria’s poorest workers directly. \n\n“While increasing the demand for wage workers is a key policy priority, the vast majority of employed Nigerians – especially from poorer households – do not currently hold such jobs. This limits the direct effects that policies focusing on subsets of wage workers can have on poverty. \n\n“In particular, public sector wage jobs are not only rare and disproportionately occupied by comparatively better off Nigerians; they also pay significantly more than private sector and other types of wage jobs, even after taking individual characteristics into account, suggesting there are additional barriers to entry into public sector jobs, which may lock out the poor and economically insecure.” \n\nIt also noted enforcement challenges, with about one-third of private sector employees earning less than the official minimum wage, stating, “Similarly, minimum wage legislation may not directly reach the poorest workers because they do not hold wage jobs and around a third of private sector wage earners receive less than minimum wage anyway, demonstrating that enforcement is imperfect.” \n\nThe report cautioned that increasing wages and public sector pay could strain government finances, suggesting that broader employment policies are needed to reduce poverty effectively.\n\nWhat you should know \n\nNairametrics earlier reported that 84% of Nigeria’s working-class population is self-employed in the first quarter of 2024, reflecting a decrease from the 87.3% recorded in Q3 2023.\n\n- The report indicates a decline of 3.3% points in the self-employment rate, highlighting a shift within the labour market.\n\n- Also, Nigeria continues to grapple with a high rate of informal employment.\n\n- According to the NBS report, 92.7% of the country’s employed population is engaged in informal work.\n\n- Dr Tope Fasua, Special Adviser to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on Economic Affairs, recently disclosed that a significant number of Nigerians work in unstructured environments.\n\n- He noted that only about 7-8% of the working population in the country is under wage employment, which is controlled by the National Labour Congress (NLC).\n\n- The Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms, Taiwo Oyedele, earlier said that about 81% of Nigerians in the employment pool are not in any productive sector of the economy.\n\n- An African Development Bank (AfDB) report noted that about 34.3% of Nigerian workers, aged 15 and older, are working poor, living below the poverty line despite being employed. According to the Nigeria Country Diagnostic Note (CDN) 2023, many workers in Nigeria are trapped in poverty due to low-skilled and low-wage jobs.",

   "source": "Ghana Web",
   "Content": "The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reviewed the Fund’s charges and surcharge policy, resulting in a cut on the cost of borrowing.\n\nMs Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the IMF, issued a statement following the conclusion of the review, saying: “In a challenging global environment and at a time of high interest rates, our membership has reached consensus on a comprehensive package that substantially reduces the cost of borrowing while safeguarding the IMF's financial capacity to support countries in need.\"\n\nShe said: “The approved measures will lower IMF borrowing costs for members by 36 per cent, or about US$1.2 billion annually,” explaining: “The expected number of countries subject to surcharges in fiscal year 2026 will fall from 20 to 13.”\n\n“This is achieved by reducing the margin over the SDR interest rate, raising the threshold for level-based surcharges, lowering the rate for time-based surcharges, and increasing the thresholds for commitment fees,” Ms Georgieva noted.\n\nThe approved package will take effect on November 1, 2024.\n\n“While substantially lowered, charges and surcharges remain an essential part of the IMF’s cooperative lending and risk management framework, where all members contribute and all can benefit from support when needed,” she pointed out.\n\nShe said: “Together, charges and surcharges cover lending intermediation expenses, help accumulate reserves to protect against financial risks, and provide incentives for prudent borrowing.”\n\n“This provides a strong financial foundation that allows the IMF to extend vital balance of payments support on affordable terms to member countries when they need it most,” explained the MD.\n\n“This reform helps ensure that the IMF can continue serving our members in a changing world,\" she mentioned.",

   "Content": "The CEO of the Private Enterprise Foundation, Nana Osei Bonsu, says the way forward for Ghana’s businesses lies in the private sector taking the lead in restoring the country’s economic vitality.\n\nSpeaking on Joy News’ PM Express Business Edition, Mr Bonsu outlined his vision for a path to recovery, emphasising the importance of investing in local businesses to create wealth and jobs.\n\n“People set up businesses to make money, not to create jobs. But when they make money, that’s when they can hire more people,” Mr. Bonsu explained.\n\nHe stressed that for businesses to thrive and ultimately contribute to job creation, there must be an enabling environment that allows them to recover investments and grow sustainably.\n\nAccording to Mr Bonsu, the key to economic recovery is support for infrastructure development and a more favourable business environment.\n\nHe criticised the current policies, pointing out that Ghana often focuses on attracting foreign investments while neglecting the local private sector.\n\n“We go around the world enticing big players and giving them tax breaks, but what about the small potatoes—the local businesses? They are the ones who can drive the recovery.”\n\nHe also discussed the importance of future policy frameworks that prioritize the private sector.\n\nAs Ghana approaches a new government administration in 2025, Bonsu urged the authorities to align more with the needs of local businesses.\n\n“We should be asking, what do we want to do, and who do we rely on? The private sector is the vehicle to ensure Ghana’s economy prospers,” he stated.\n\nLooking forward, he emphasized the necessity of better collaboration between the private sector and the government.\n\n“Hang your coat on the private sector,” he advised, adding that the sector holds the potential to create wealth and increase government revenue through sustainable business growth.",

   "Content": "Ghana’s business community is still struggling to recover from the impact of the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP), according to Nana Osei Bonsu, the Chief Executive Officer of the Private Enterprise Foundation.\n\nIn an interview on Joy News’ PM Express Business Edition, he made it clear that the private sector, in particular, is feeling the brunt of the debt restructuring initiative, and the nation has not yet “turned the corner” in terms of recovery.\n\n“We haven’t recovered,” Mr. Bonsu said plainly.\n\n“We’re still reeling from the high cost of doing business and high interest rates. To the authorities, it might seem like recovery because we’re in the process, but for businesses, we are not there yet. We are still stumbling.”\n\nThe CEO explained that businesses continue to face challenges, particularly in competing internationally.\n\nHe highlighted that the interest rates and costs of doing business in Ghana remain high compared to global peers.\n\n“We’re competing in an international arena where others have interest costs at less than 8%, while ours is still very high. So how can we say we’ve recovered?” he questioned.\n\nMr Bonsu also raised concerns about Ghana’s participation in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), stating that although the country has opened its doors to international players, local businesses remain disadvantaged.\n\n“Our taste buds always prefer non-local products. The international players come in and we dangle tax exemptions at them. What are we benefiting from this? What are we doing to boost local businesses?” he lamented.\n\nThe domestic debt exchange, which deprived private businesses of much-needed income, is still casting a shadow over Ghana’s economic landscape.\n\nAccording to Bonsu, the situation has resulted in significant job losses and reduced productivity, with many businesses still unable to bounce back.\n\n“We didn’t approve of the debt exchange wholeheartedly because we had no alternative. Our hard-earned interest and income were taken away,” he said, adding that the recovery process is ongoing but far from complete.",

   "Content": "The World Bank expects Nigeria’s inflation to drop to 14.3 percent by 2027 as the country stays on course in its ongoing macroeconomic reforms that have elevated prices and deepen poverty.\n\nIn its new Nigeria Development Update report, the Washington-based lender said headline inflation is projected to peak at an average annual rate of 31.7 percent in 2024, largely driven by the depreciation of the naira and increased gasoline prices.\n\n“In the medium term, recent macroeconomic reforms and their continuation will help to reduce inflation, expected to fall to 14.3 percent by 2027,” the World Bank said.\n\nThe Bank admits that though the fiscal reforms are painful, they are needed from saving the country from imminent collapse and have begun to yield results.\n\nNigeria’s inflation after reaching a 28-year high of 34.2 percent in June 2024, began to decelerate in July and fell to 32.15 percent in August, fanning hope of respite for households and firms who have seen their purchasing power shrunk and gains eroded.\n\nBut the spike has begun again as September data surged to 32.7 percent on the back of the about 50 percent new total increase in petrol prices across the country.\n\nThis development, according to many analysts, will further stoke prices and raise the burden of the already burdened ordinary Nigerians who are most squeezed by the pump price.\n\nNigerians are now grappling with rising energy costs, soaring food prices and transportation fare and a depleting consumer spending.\n\nBut the World Bank said “a series of macroeconomic policy missteps in 2015-\n2023 contributed to an inflation surge in Nigeria”.\n\nAccording to the report, headline inflation was broadly stable up until 2014, in high single digits or low two digits, not so distant from the levels observed in other major emerging markets.\n\nIt however stated that from 2015, when the CBN shifted its primary focus away from price stability – its core mandate, money supply began to rise that between 2015 and 2023, the confidence in the naira had already been sapped, pushing up inflation.\n\n“As a result, inflation was surging, even before the series of reforms which began in mid-2023, reaching 22.4 percent yoy in May 2023,” the report stated.\n\nIn its forecast, the Bretton Woods institution anticipates Nigeria’s inflation to begin to moderate, declining to 23.5 percent by 2025, 18.1 percent by 2026 and consequently 14.3 percent by 2027.",

   "Content": "NAIROBI, Oct 17 (Reuters) – Kenya’s senate voted to dismiss Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua from office by impeachment on five out of 11 charges levelled against him on Thursday, in an unprecedented move that risks pushing the country towards a political crisis.\n\nThe National Assembly voted last week to impeach Gachagua, who helped President William Ruto win an election two years ago but has been assailed by allies of the president over alleged disloyalty and a series of provocative public comments.\n\nFifty-four out of 67 senators voted to dismiss Gachagua on the first count of “gross violation of the constitution”, more than the two-thirds majority required under the law, making him the first Kenyan president or deputy president forced from office by impeachment.\n\n“Accordingly, His Excellency Rigathi Gachagua… ceases to hold office,” said Senate Speaker Amason Kingi.\n\nThe process, however, is unlikely to stop there. Gachagua has filed several petitions challenging the push to oust him, and the chief justice has appointed a panel of three judges to examine them.\n\nGachagua, who has denied the allegations, had been due to defend himself against the charges in the Senate on Thursday afternoon ahead of the vote.\n\nWhen he failed to show up, his lawyer Paul Muite said the deputy president had been hospitalised with intense chest pains, urging the Senate to pause proceedings for a couple of days.\n\nBut the senate declined to do so, prompting Gachagua’s legal team to leave the chambers in protest.\n\nDan Gikonyo, a doctor treating Gachagua, told reporters the deputy president was admitted to a Nairobi hospital with heart trouble on Thursday afternoon, but was now stable and would likely have to remain in hospital for 24-72 hours.\n\nSome senators questioned the decision to proceed with the vote, despite Gachagua’s absence.\n\n“We are to try a man in hospital because the only crime that Rigathi Gachagua has committed is a political crime, so he has to be removed out of the way, whatever it will take,” said Senator John Methu.\n\nBut Senator Moses Otieno Kajwang defended the move to impeach Gachagua, saying, “we must drain the swamp”.\n\nRISKS FOR RUTO\n\nRuto, who has fallen out with Gachagua in recent months, has not commented on the proceedings, but could face a public backlash following the impeachment, political analysts said.\n\nMany Kenyans view the impeachment process as politically motivated, and a distraction from the aftermath of the deadly anti-tax protests in June and July that exposed deep discontent with government policies and alleged corruption.\n\nThe hearings, which have involved in-depth scrutiny of Gachagua’s finances, could boomerang back at Ruto, said Karuti Kanyinga, a professor at the University of Nairobi’s Institute for Development Studies.\n\n“We are going to hear people demanding that the same thing that has been done on Gachagua be done to the president,” Kanyinga said.\n\nGachagua, who has previously called the impeachment process a political lynching based on falsehoods, had been due to respond to a litany of accusations laid out on Wednesday by lawmaker Mwengi Mutuse, who accusedhim of inciting ethnic hatred.\n\nMutuse also accused Gachagua of acquiring properties worth over $40 million since becoming deputy president, despite reporting a net worth of only around $6 million before entering office.\n\nElisha Ongoya, a member of Gachagua’s legal team, said the allegations lacked evidence and were based on speculation.\n\n(Reporting by Hereward Holland, Ammu Kannampilly, George Obulutsa and Sonia Rao; Editing by Christina Fincher, Ammu Kannampilly, Bernadette Baum, Bill Berkrot and Marguerita Choy)",

   "source": "Business Daily Africa",
   "Content": "The Energy and Petroleum Ministry has threatened to crack down on filling stations that have continued to sell fuel at high prices, despite lower prices announced on Tuesday.\n\nCabinet Secretary (CS) Opiyo Wandayi said that some filling stations were yet to lower the pump prices despite the adjustments by the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) that saw the prices of a litre of petrol, diesel, and kerosene drop by Sh8.18, Sh3.54, and Sh6.93, respectively.\n\n“It has come to our attention that very many petroleum dealers and owners of petrol stations have either failed or refused to comply with the new pump prices that were unveiled on October 15. We are sounding out a warning to all those who are culpable to immediately comply with the new pump prices that will run up to November 14,” he said.\n\nEpra on Tuesday announced the biggest drop in fuel prices in 19 months, which left a litre of petrol retailing at Sh180.66, diesel at Sh168.06, and kerosene at Sh151.39.\n\nThis was after the landed cost for the fuels dropped by between 5.5 percent and 8.6 percent.\n\nThe reduction on a litre of petrol moved from Sh3.40 in August, to Sh0.83 last month and closed at the current month’s Sh8.18. The reduction is, however, despite Epra’s refusal to comply with a court directive to reverse the road maintenance levy- which forms part of the fuel prices- from Sh25 to Sh18 per litre.\n\nMr Wandayi, however, noted that even after the reduction which took effect on Tuesday and the new prices to be applied for a month until November 14, it was unfortunate that many filling stations have continued to sell the products at high prices.\n\n“We have mobilised all our lawful agencies to crack down on those businesses that will fail to comply with these new pump prices,” the CS said.\n\nHe also appealed to Kenyans to report cases of petrol dealers failing to enforce the new pump prices.",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "Transcorp Power Plc has established itself as a key player in Nigeria’s power sector, consistently delivering strong financial results that reflect its growth-driven strategy and operational efficiency.\n\nThe company reported an impressive 198% YoY growth in pre-tax profit for the first nine months of 2024, driven by robust revenue growth.\n\nHowever, despite this impressive performance, the company’s stock appears to be rallying below its financial growth, prompting a key question: Is now the right time to buy Transcorp Power’s stock?\n \nAfter its introduction on March 4, 2024, Transcorp Power’s stock experienced an impressive 42% year-to-date (YTD) gain by the end of Q1 2024. However, as of the close of trading on October 14, the stock’s YTD gain has decreased by 14.28%.\n\nThis raises the possibility that the market may be mispricing the stock, potentially providing investors with a chance to buy at a discount.\n\nAn analysis of the company’s performance could offer valuable insights into whether this presents a compelling opportunity or if it is a situation warranting a cautious wait-and-see approach.\n\nStrong Financial Performance:\n\nThe recently released 9-month results for 2024 showcase a robust performance across critical metrics. Pre-tax profit soared by 198% YoY to N81.121 billion, surpassing the company’s total profit for the entire year of 2023 by an impressive 54%.\n\nBoth pre-tax and post-tax margins improved significantly, reaching 36% and 26%, respectively, which boosted return on equity (ROE) to 56%.\n\nThis strong bottom-line performance is supported by remarkable growth in revenue, primarily driven by an increase in energy sold. The volume of energy sold, a major contributor to overall revenue surged by 164% YoY, accounting for 67% of the total 153% YoY growth, which reached N223.556 billion.\n\nCommenting on the results, Evans Okpogoro, Chief Financial Officer of Transcorp Power, expressed strong confidence in the company’s financial trajectory, stating:\n\n“We are proud to announce significant growth across all our metrics. Our commitment to disciplined cost management and operational efficiency has not only enabled us to sustain robust margins but has also positioned us to outperform industry averages in key areas. This achievement reflects our strategic focus, and dedication to excellence, and solidifies our leadership position in Nigeria’s power sector.” \n\nThe impressive performance in the first nine months of the year suggests a sustained growth trend.\n\nFor example, achieving a return on equity (ROE) of 56% and a return on assets of 16.2%; both already higher than the full-year 2023 ROE of 52.3% and ROA of 13.5% is particularly remarkable, especially for a utility company.\n\nSuch metrics reflect not only strong profitability but also effective asset utilization, reinforcing the company’s operational efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, the company’s performance is particularly noteworthy given Nigeria’s chronic power challenges and the surging costs of operations, reflected in the rising cost of sales and a decline in gross profit margin for most companies.\n\nSales costs grew by 177% to N127.093 billion, primarily driven by the soaring natural gas and fuel costs, which increased by over 200%.\n\nDespite these cost pressures, the gross profit margin remains healthy at 43%, underscoring the company’s ability to manage costs efficiently in a difficult operating environment.\n\nTo get the complete picture, it is crucial also to look at the company’s financial health and risk profile. The balance sheet expanded by 62% to N362.5 billion in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nLiquidity is another promising indicator of the company’s financial position. The current ratio improved to 1.4x, reflecting a 13% increase, suggesting that the company is well positioned to cover its short-term liabilities with its current assets.\n\nThis is particularly vital in the energy sector, where cash flow fluctuations can arise from external factors such as regulatory changes or fuel price volatility.\n\nMoreover, Transcorp Power’s leverage ratios reveal a prudent approach to debt management, as seen in the reductions in equity multiples and debt-to-asset ratios.\n\nThis decline in leverage may lower the risk of financial distress, providing an additional layer of stability.\n\nThe interest coverage ratio also improved to 10.18x from 7.63x, highlighting the company’s ability to meet interest obligations comfortably. This indicates that the company generates enough earnings before interest and taxes to cover its interest expenses multiple times over.\n\nOverall, Transcorp Power’s financial health paints a picture of a well-managed company with strong growth potential.\n\nBeyond these impressive figures and metrics, total return and value are also essential considerations for shareholders.\n\nThe company has paid a total dividend of N34.65B since its listing, which represents 23.4B as FY 2023 dividend and 11.25B for 2024 interim dividends. With nine-month earnings already 93% above the earnings of 2023, analysts believe the company is likely to increase its final dividend at the end of 2024.\n\nCurrently, the stock offers a total return of 14.78% and a consideration of the valuation ratios; earnings multiples, price-to-sales, and price-to-book ratios, which are below industry standards, indicates not only an undervaluation, but that investors are not fully pricing in these factors, possibly due to perceived risks or market skepticism about future profitability, policy shifts, etc.\n\nFor value investors, this might signal an opportunity to buy, as it suggests potential upside, if the market adjusts its valuation in line with the company’s underlying assets, revenue, and earnings, provided that the company can navigate sector challenges effectively and sustain its growth trend.\n\nTranscorp Power’s strategic intent for 2024 aims to establish it as a leading power company, with a goal of surpassing N500 billion in annual revenue by 2031. With revenue of N224 billion already achieved in the first nine months of 2024, the company appears well-positioned to meet this ambitious growth target.\n\nIn this context, comments from the company’s Managing Director provide further reassurance\n\nCommenting on the Q3 2024 results, Peter Ikenga, MD/CEO of Transcorp Power Plc, stated: \n\n“Despite the infrastructural challenges faced in the power sector, Transcorp Power has once again demonstrated exceptional financial growth, as reflected in our impressive results.\n\n“We continue to strive to bridge the energy gap in Nigeria, in line with our purpose to improve lives.\n\n“I am proud to report that we have sustained our remarkable growth trajectory and maintained our position as a leading contributor to the country’s power sector, accounting for approximately 10% of total power generated on the national grid.\n\nAs the market transitions into bilateral contracts, as outlined in the Electricity Act, we are optimistic about sustaining this momentum by capitalizing on strategic investment opportunities and providing additional value to our shareholders.”",

   "source": "My Joy Online",
   "Content": "Ghana’s monetary policy rate of 27.0% is the highest in Africa, the World Bank has revealed.\n\nIn its latest October 2024 Africa Pulse Report, the World Bank said the Bank of Ghana and other Central Banks have kept interest rates higher to anchor inflation expectations properly and secure a smoother path to their inflation targets.\n\n“Central banks in countries that still have double-digit inflation and weakened domestic currencies (such as Angola, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone) will keep monetary policy rates higher for longer and, in fewer cases, they may increase their policy rates—particularly in countries where inflation rates still have not peaked. Broadly, currency weakness, slow fiscal adjustment, and cost pressures are among the factors driving these countries to keep a tighter stance for a longer period”.\n\nFor instance, it said Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria are among the worst performing in Africa this year, and their currencies continue weakening while demand for foreign exchange remains pressing.\n\nNonetheless, the World Bank pointed out that with an improving inflation outlook and stabilising currencies, some countries are likely to end their hiking cycle and start reducing monetary policy rates.\n\nHowever, price stickiness and the need to anchor expectations and restore the ability to achieve targets may delay benchmark rate cuts.\n\nBoG cuts policy rate to 27.0% in September 2024\n\nThe Bank of Ghana cut its benchmark policy rate by 200 basis points to 27.0% in September 2024, the second rate cut since 2021.\n\nBefore that, UK-based Fitch Solutions in August 2024 stated that the Bank of Ghana would cut its policy rate by 200 basis points before the end of 2024.\n\nThe UK-based firm said though this decision aligned with its expectations, the significant depreciation of the cedi and the BoG’s hawkish tone have promoted it to revise its end-2024 forecast upward from 25.00%.",

   "source": "Business Daily Africa",
   "Content": "An option granted to investors by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to directly purchase government securities, including Treasury bills and bonds, through a digital portal has rattled commercial banks amid an exodus of clients.\n\nCBK in July 2023, launched an improved over-the-counter trading platform dubbed DhowCSD that has allowed investors to open and transact on the central security depository (CSD) accounts from the convenience of smartphones and the internet.\n\nThis has eliminated the previously lengthy process of physically visiting the CBK to open securities trading accounts.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya in Nairobi.\n\nThe banks said that the switch has resulted in competition for deposits, raising their cost of funds, and are now asking the State to intervene to manage the loss of their intermediary role.\n\nBuyers of Treasury bills and bonds previously bought T-bills and bonds through banks before the CBK introduced the direct-window option.\n\n“Bank respondents indicated that there was a need for intervention by the government to manage disintermediation of banks as fixed-term deposit customers switch to the purchase of T-bills and T-bonds and thus increasing the cost of deposits, heightening aggressive competition for wholesale deposits between banks and crowding out lending to the private sector,” commercial banks told CBK in survey responses.\n\nHigh interest rates on Treasury bills and bonds along with the liberalisation of government securities access through the DhowCSD platform, has increased the participation of retail investors in the direct purchase of the securities.\n\nYields on government securities reached new highs this year as the CBK raised its benchmark lending rate and the government’s risk profile soared, lifting the return on Treasuries.\n\nFebruary’s tax-free infrastructure bond for instance delivered a coupon/interest rate of 18.46 percent making it the highest-grossing asset in 2024.\n\nThe upgraded CDS infrastructure- DhowCSD which went live on July 31 last year, boosted efficiency in investing in government securities by allowing retail investors to buy T-bills and T-bonds through their smartphones.\n\nSignups to the platform crossed the 80,000 mark by June this year with the number of CDS accounts doubling in the past year.\n\nHoldings of government domestic debt by retail investors have increased after the launch of DhowCSD reaching a share of 13.53 percent as of October 9, 2024, or Sh730 billion compared to a share of 7.13 percent, or Sh342 billion as at the end of June last year.\n\nThe retail investors who are categorised as other investors currently hold a greater share of government domestic debt than insurance companies and parastatals combined.\n\nCommercial banks have responded to the attraction of government securities to retail investors, by sweetening their return on time and savings deposits/term deposits.\n\nThe average commercial bank deposit rate for instance soared to a peak of 11.48 percent in June this year, compared to 7.8 percent at the same time last year.\n\nFixed deposit balances rose to surpass Sh2 trillion for the first time in July, anchored on the sweetened returns despite the banks' fright of the switch to government securities.\n\nThe balances touched Sh2.02 trillion, representing a 13.6 percent growth rate from Sh1.76 trillion in July 2023. Commercial banks have previously lamented the crowding out of the private sector in credit disbursements.\n\nThe higher return paid out to bank term depositors has raised the commercial banks' funding base, putting pressure on their lending margins which form the bread and butter of the industry’s earnings.\n\nInterest rates on both fixed deposits and government securities are however set for a downshift in the near term as domestic rates moderate.",

   "source": "CNBC Africa",
   "Content": "ABUJA, Oct 17 (Reuters) – Nigeria is beginning to reap the benefits of significant policy reforms following a near fiscal crisis in 2020, but must stay the course, the World Bank said on Thursday.\n\nPresident Bola Tinubu has instituted reforms including ending a decades-old petrol subsidy and devaluing the currency to try to boost output, which has been sluggish for about a decade.\n\nWorld Bank lead economist for Nigeria Alex Sienaert said that Nigeria’s fiscal deficit has reduced from 6.2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first half of last year to 4.4% in the first half of this year, with the reforms leading to robust growth in service sectors, stability in the oil sector, and improvements in the foreign exchange market.\n\n“We are seeing a fiscal consolidation underway with the fiscal deficit shrinking and that’s driven by a combination of expenditure being roughly constant in real terms, and revenues which are surging,” Sienaert said during a presentation in the capital Abuja.\n\n“This surge in revenues is largely due to the removal of the implicit forex subsidy that was happening before, which was even larger than the petrol subsidy, which we talk a lot about,” he said.\n\nThe World Bank expects Nigeria’s economy to grow at 3.3% this year, rising to 3.6% in 2025.\n\nNigeria’s fiscal crisis had been mounting following two economic recessions in the last eight years due to a combination of economic mismanagement and policy challenges.\n\nThe recent reforms, including a focus on price stability and a unified market-reflective exchange rate by the central bank, have proven critical in stemming an economic downturn, but they have stoked inflation.\n\n“The ultimate purpose here, of course, is jobs and opportunities,” Sienaert said.\n\n(Reporting by Elisha Bala-Gbogbo; Editing by Angus MacSwan)",

The services sector grew 5.8%, while agriculture rose 5.4%, Annim said.\n\nThe cocoa sector in the world's second biggest producer, however, contracted for the fourth consecutive quarter by 26.2%, highlighting the impact of a steady decline in crop output due to disease and poor weather.\n\nThe economic rebound is another boost to the West African state as it restructures its debt. It has invited holders of roughly $13 billion of its international bonds to swap their holdings for new instruments after reaching a preliminary restructuring agreement with two bondholder groups.\n\nBondholders have until Sept. 30 to accept the offer though those who agree to do so before an early deadline on Sept. 20 will be eligible for a 1% consent fee.",

They accounted for 51.1 percent of mobile loans, 49.6 percent of personal loans, and 16.5 percent of asset finance, highlighting their active role in Kenya’s borrowing landscape.\n\n“This demographic’s strong presence underscores the need for financial institutions to innovate and provide products that cater to the unique preferences and behaviours of younger borrowers,” said Morris Maina, Chief Executive Officer CEO at TransUnion Kenya.",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "The CEO of Nigeria’s Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOFI), Dr. Taikang Armstrong, has called for urgent reforms in the corporate governance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), stressing that their poor management is stalling the country’s economic progress.\n\nSpeaking at the 2024 Annual Corporate Governance Conference, Dr. Armstrong emphasized the need for accountability and strategic investments to revive these critical entities, highlighting that Nigeria’s wealth is being wasted rather than invested in long-term growth.\n\nDr. Armstrong pointed out key examples of underperforming state-owned enterprises, such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Bank of Agriculture, and the Federal Mortgage Bank.\n\n“These enterprises were created to drive key sectors like energy, housing, and agriculture, unfortunately, their poor performance, driven by weak governance, has stunted Nigeria’s development.” he said.\n\nHe drew attention to the energy sector, particularly the NNPC, saying, “For every barrel of oil we take from the ground and spend the money, if we do not invest it in appreciating assets, we are depreciating our common wealth. The revenues from oil have not been reinvested in long-term projects, and that explains why, despite our oil wealth, we are poorer.” \n\nThe mismanagement of resources  \nDr. Armstrong was particularly critical of how resources from Nigeria’s oil industry have been managed, warning that much of it has been spent on consumption rather than productive investment.\n\nHe explained, “In Singapore, for instance, there was legislation that stipulated you don’t borrow for consumption; you borrow for investment. Unfortunately, Nigeria has not adopted this mindset. Our oil wealth is being spent on expenditure that doesn’t generate returns.” \n\nHe further emphasized, “If we took out all the money that we had and built infrastructure like the steel companies, NITEL, Nigerian Shipping Lines, NEPA, and none of those created value, we have been impoverishing ourselves for decades. That explains why we are where we are. Despite the oil wealth, we have grown poorer because the revenues were not reinvested in appreciating assets.” \n\nCall for reinvestment and legislative reforms  \nDr. Armstrong stressed the importance of legislative action to reverse these trends. “We have a collective responsibility to ask questions and ensure that whatever input we can make in the legislative process, things like that are legislated,” he said.\n\nHe called for laws that would ensure that a portion of the country’s revenues from assets like oil are reinvested in projects that generate long-term returns. “There is no law that says for every asset you sell, a certain percentage must be reinvested. I hope you know that,” he remarked, calling attention to the current lack of accountability.\n\nHe also urged stakeholders to critically evaluate Nigeria’s budget, particularly distinguishing between capital and investment expenditures. “The fact that a line item in the budget says ‘capital expenditure’ doesn’t mean it will deliver returns in the long term. Capital expenditure should mean investment, something that appreciates in value. Otherwise, we’re just depreciating our common wealth,” Armstrong explained.\n\nCorporate governance must be prioritized \nArmstrong stressed that poor governance across state-owned enterprises has been a critical barrier to Nigeria’s development. “Without significant reforms in governance, these enterprises will continue to drag our economy down,” he said. He also pushed for better accountability and transparency, warning that if action is not taken, “Nigeria’s development dreams will remain just that—dreams.” \n\nHe suggested that Nigeria could learn from the governance models of other nations. “Look at China’s state-owned enterprises; they are government-run but extremely successful at driving industrialization and economic growth. Nigeria can learn from these models,” he stated.\n\nHe also promoted the idea of state-driven capitalism, where the government can actively invest in critical sectors without sacrificing efficiency. “We need a model that works for Nigeria, one where the state takes the lead in key industries but with strict oversight and governance,” he added.\n\nDr. Armstrong called for more stringent oversight of state-run enterprises, especially in their debt management. “We’ve seen many of these enterprises take on debt without generating the revenue to repay it. This cannot continue,” he emphasized.\n\nHe also issued a stern warning on the repercussions of continued mismanagement: “If we do not hold these enterprises accountable, Nigeria’s future prosperity will be at risk.” \n\nHe concluded by highlighting the urgency of reforming Nigeria’s state-owned enterprises. “The success of these firms is essential to Nigeria’s economic future. Poor governance is keeping us from realizing our potential, but with the right reforms, we can turn the tide,” he said.",

   "Content": "Aradel Holdings is set to officially list its shares on the Main Board of the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) at N702.69 per share on Monday, October 14, 2024.\n\nThis follows the company’s recent announcement that it has signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with global energy giant TotalEnergies and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to acquire a 100% interest in the Olo and Olo West marginal fields, located onshore in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to information obtained by Nairametrics, the acquisition was finalized with a purchase consideration of $16 million, alongside an additional $3.5 million in deferred and conditional payments.\n\nThis marks a significant step in Aradel’s expansion in Nigeria’s energy sector, adding to its asset portfolio.\n\nThe listing details were released by Chapel Hill Denham, the advisory firm managing Aradel’s listing by introduction on the NGX.\n\nThe company will offer 4.34 billion ordinary shares with a nominal value of N0.50 each, priced at N702.69 per share. This will result in a market capitalization of approximately N3.06 trillion.\n\nShare Re-denomination and Growth\n\nAradel Holdings began trading on the NASD OTC market in early 2024, initially priced at N1,089 per share. By September 4, 2024, the share price had soared to N9,867.38, reflecting significant investor interest.\n\nIn a strategic move on September 30, 2024, the company implemented a share re-denomination, adjusting the nominal value to N0.50 and splitting each share into 20.\n\nPost-split, the stock price was recalibrated to N469.95 per share.\n\nDespite the re-denomination, Aradel’s stock continued to surge, closing at N641.06 by October 9, 2024—a 36% increase within just a few days.\n\nThis performance highlights the company’s strong showing on the NASD OTC platform, which has served as a launchpad for its transition to the NGX.\n\nThe move to the NGX Main Board marks a crucial milestone for Aradel Holdings, providing broader market access and positioning the company for continued growth in the Nigerian energy landscape.\n\nA long-term strategy \nAradel’s NGX listing is part of the company’s broader strategic plan outlined in its 2023 annual report, published in May 2024. Chairman Ladi Jadesimi emphasized the company’s commitment to sustaining its growth momentum while achieving a successful listing on the Nigerian Exchange before the close of the year.\n\n“In 2024, our strategic priorities remain clear: to maintain our growth momentum, secure a smooth listing on the Nigerian Exchange, and optimize our asset base, while ensuring effective succession planning for our leadership,” Jadesimi said.\n\nThis vision was echoed by Managing Director and CEO, Gbite Falade, who, in August, confirmed that Aradel was on track to meet its listing goals by the end of the third quarter.\n\nStrong financial performance \n\n- Aradel’s impressive financial results have further bolstered its market positioning ahead of the NGX listing.\n\n- In August 2024, the company released its audited financials on the NASD OTC platform, reporting a pre-tax profit of N122.78 billion for Q2 2024 an astounding 535.16% increase compared to N19.33 billion in the same period of 2023.\n\n- Revenue also surged 199% year-on-year, reaching N167.14 billion, up from N55.83 billion in 2023.\n\n- With the acquisition of the Olo and Olo West fields and its upcoming listing, Aradel Holdings is positioning to strengthen its presence in the Nigerian energy sector.",

   "Content": "Taiwo Oyedele, Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms, has dismissed reports suggesting that the committee is proposing a reduction in the federal government’s share of the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) to 10%.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Oyedele responded to claims suggesting that his committee is advocating for the federal government to receive only 10% of FAAC, while the remaining 90% would go to state and local governments.\n\nHe clarified that the report does not reflect the committee’s position, as their reforms focus solely on Value Added Tax (VAT) within the FAAC framework and do not encompass all revenue allocated to the government’s account.\n \n“We did not recommend a reduction in the federal government’s share from the federation account.  \n\n“Our recommendation is in respect of VAT revenue, to increase the share of states and local governments from 85% to 90% and for states to discontinue with their other forms of consumption taxes which constitute multiple taxation on businesses and individuals,” Oyedele said. \n\nBackstory\n\nEarlier today, it was reported on various media outlets, (not Nairametrics) that the federal government is proposing a shift in the revenue allocation of the FAAC, with 90% of the distribution given to the State and local government.\n\nThe report claimed this represents a drastic departure from the current sharing formula, which allegedly allocates 52.68% to the federal government, 26.72% to states, and 20.60% to local governments.\n\nUnder the new proposal, the report alleged that Oyedele explained the distribution formula for the states and local governments would include a clause stipulating that 60% of their share would be based on the principle of derivation.\n\nIn practice, it was claimed that if N100 is available for distribution from FAAC, the federal government would take N10, all 36 states would share N36 equally, and N54 would be distributed based on derivation, favouring states with higher resource generation.\n\nMeanwhile, Oyedele refuted this claim, stating that the bill only proposed the allocation of VAT revenue in the FAAC.\n\nWhat you should know\n\nAccording to the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) under the Presidency, the distribution of the country’s monthly revenue allocates 52.68% to the Federal Government, 26.72% to states, and 20.60% to local governments, disbursed through the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\n\n- Interestingly, funds for local governments are deposited into a joint account managed by state governments and local governments within their jurisdictions.\n\n- However, these funds are rarely allocated to the local government chairmen, therefore bringing to question the effective practice of an independent local government.\n\n- With the Supreme Court ruling on fiscal autonomy for local government, the payment of FAAC meant for the third tier of government will be directly allocated to each local government.",

Peckshield confirmed that the cryptocurrency investor lost 108 billion PEPE, 73.8 million APU, and 165,000 MSTR tokens after getting tricked into signing a phishing permit signature transaction.\n \nPeckshield alerts shared there findings on the development on their X page.\n\n“ #PeckShieldAlert The address 0xb0b8…40c7 has been drained of ~$1.28M worth of cryptos, including 108B $PEPE, 73.8M $APU, and 165K $MSTR, after signing a #phishing permit signature. The #phishing address #Fake_Phishing442846 is linked to the scammers who drained $32M worth of Spark Wrapped Ethereum tokens ($spWETH) 2 weeks ago” Peckshield Tweeted\n\nThe kind of malicious attack experienced by the trader is called an approval phishing attack which transfers control of a victim’s wallet to the attacker, allowing scammers to drain the stored assets.\n\nIn the trader’s case his wallet identified by “0xb0b..40c7,” lost roughly $1.2 million worth of cryptocurrencies across six transactions within a few minutes, with the stolen assets distributed across multiple addresses controlled by the attackers.\n\nOne of the bad actor addresses, labeled as “Fake_Phishing442846”, was involved in a separate attack two weeks ago with the affected wallet losing over $32 million worth of spWETH tokens after signing a similar malicious transaction.\n\nInferno Drainer \n\nArkham Intelligence another Blockchain intelligence firm reporting on the event confirmed that the attack was carried out using Inferno drainer a multichain cryptocurrency scam service provider.\n\nThe Inferno Drainer was created solely to cater to Bad actors in the crypto industry and have been heavily criticized for its role in phishing scams.\n\nTill this date, Inferno Drainer has targeted several crypto-related projects, managing to steal over $230 million from over 200,000 victims per Dune analytics data. On Nov. 26, 2023, the developers announced plans to sunset the service indefinitely. But later in 2024 the service was brought back due to high demand from its customers.\n\nWhat to Know  \n\n- Inferno Drainer is a subscription-based phishing-as-a-service tool that allows criminals to create malicious websites and applications to trick users into signing over control of their wallets. The developers charge scammers 30% for making phishing websites and another 20% for each successful attack.\n\n- According to an August report by Chainalysis, Phishing attacks are directly responsible for the loss of over $2.7 billion since 2021.",

Currently, commercial rates remain as high as 20 percent.\n\n“Lending to the manufacturing sector is not doing well and is weighing down our economy,” he said, calling on the banking sector to extend credit facilities to manufacturers, as Kenya continues to import goods that could be produced locally, limiting job creation and depleting foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAdvertisement.

   "source": "My Joy Online",
   "Content": "Telecommunications giant, MTN Ghana, has blamed the recent interruptions in call and internet services on fibre cuts mainly occasioned by the activities of road contractors, property developers and other related activities.\n\n\nIt said construction machines negligently continued to damage the fibre optic cables, a critical infrastructure, despite consistent engagements with relevant associations, describing the situation as disheartening.\n\nSubscribers of MTN have in recent times lamented the rough nature of the network which sometimes makes it difficult to establish call connections, access the internet or hear a call party.\n\nThe South West Technical Manager of the company, Teddy Hayford Acquah, explaining the situation at a media and stakeholder forum in Cape Coast, indicated that between 70 to 80 per cent of the issues were fibre-related.\n\nA few other issues were theft cases where people broke into cell sites and stole batteries, fuel, equipment, and other critical components.\n\n\nHe revealed that of the more than 600km of fibre cables belonging to MTN in the Central Region, 62km had been damaged this year alone, costing the company some five million cedis to fix.\n\n“When it happens, service will go off if there are no alternative routes,” he explained, indicating that MTN had invested heavily in redundancies with fibre cables running from Cape Coast to Takoradi, Yamoransa and Assin, Winneba, Accra, Swedru, Kasoa, Twifo Praso and other areas.\n\nHowever, the ongoing road dualisation project in Kasoa, a water pipe project at Bobikuma, and some developments along the Agona Swedru route were damaging the cables with impunity.\n\n“So, if we are not fortunate and Kasoa goes down, which is happening every day, and these water people cut your cable, your only lifeline is the Agona Swedru cable. Once that one also goes down, that means we have a certain segment of sites that have to be isolated,” he stated.\n\n\nThe technical manager cautioned that fibre optic cables were now a national security infrastructure and appealed to authorities and the public to help protect them.\n\nHe stressed the critical importance of fibre in the emerging digital world as it had a higher capacity to ensure a smooth operationalisation of the Internet of Things, 5G network and other next-generation technologies.\n\nMr Acquah announced that MTN was working to add another 28km of fibre cables in the Central Region this year and was expected to be completed before November.\n\nThe Chief Corporate Services and Sustainability Officer, Adwoa Afriyie Wiafe, emphasised MTN’s commitment to Ghana’s economic development, announcing that the company paid about GH₵5.9 million in taxes in 2023 alone.\n\n\nBeyond that, she said they were working to contribute to the development and improve lives in many other areas such as health, education, and economic empowerment where they offered various forms of support such as infrastructure and funding.\n\nMadam Wiafe assured that the company was working assiduously with stakeholders to increase their coverage across the country to bring relief to citizens.\n\nThe Area Sales Manager, David Woasey, warned the public to be wary of Mobile Money (MoMo) fraudsters because they had devised new ways to steal from subscribers.\n\nHe assured that the company was consistently putting in place measures to protect customers but urged the customers to also take maximum precaution to protect themselves.\n\n\nHe said that at all times, customers should perform transactions by themselves and keep their PIN codes confidential always.\n\n“Do not entertain any calls relating to your MoMo account,” he warned.",

   "Content": "Nigerian crude traded at a premium, above $80 a barrel, despite moderation in China’s inflation rate and an opaque situation surrounding the country’s economic stimulus plans, which have triggered concerns about energy demand in the world’s biggest crude oil importer.\n\nNigeria’s Brass River, Bonny Light, and Qua Iboe last traded at $81 per barrel at the time of publication, much higher than the current Brent contract, as oil traders consider China’s weak economic data.\n\nThe oil market’s upside is restrained by concerns that a slowing Chinese economy may reduce demand, as well as growing optimism that the U.S. Federal Reserve might start lowering its benchmark interest rate as early as September.\n\nOfficial statistics released on Saturday showed that China’s deflationary pressures worsened in September, and a press conference on the same day left investors wondering how substantial a stimulus plan would need to be to turn things around in the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nAlthough the U.S. has warned Israel against attacking Iranian energy infrastructure, negative news from China has overshadowed market worries about the persistent threat that an Israeli response to Iran’s Oct. 1 missile launch could hamper oil supply.\n\nAccording to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the production price index dropped 2.8% year-over-year, marking the sharpest decline in six months, while the consumer price index fell short of forecasts.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures dropped by over 100 basis points to $74.56 per barrel at the start of Monday’s trading session in London, while Brent crude futures fell $1 to $78 per barrel.\n\nBoth major oil benchmarks lost all their gains from the previous week, dropping more than 1.5% per barrel before recovering some ground. Last week, WTI rose $1.18, and Brent gained 99 cents.\n\nNigeria’s oil production receives a boost\n\nAccording to the federal government, the ongoing Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) facility in Lagos is expected to produce an additional 40,000 barrels per day, increasing the nation’s existing output.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) and Century Nigeria Limited have partnered with Enserv and WAEP, an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firm, to undertake the project as a joint venture (JV).\n\nSpeaking at a project inspection in Lagos, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Oil), praised the initial progress of the work.\n\nThe minister expressed satisfaction with the advancements made, highlighting the facility’s potential to boost Nigeria’s crude oil production by an additional 40,000 barrels per day, according to his spokesman, Nneamaka Okafor.\n\nUnder President Bola Tinubu’s directive for greater output, the minister stated that the FPSO project was one of the initiatives resulting from his engagement with NNPC Limited.\n\nUpdated petrol prices hurt Nigerian residents’ earning power\n\nNigerian residents are facing a fresh fuel price hike this month, with major cities experiencing significant increases. In Lagos, Nigeria’s business capital, the price of a liter of petrol rose by 17%, from 855 to 998 naira ($0.62).\n\n-In Abuja, the federal capital, and Kano, the major northern city, the price was even higher at 1,030 naira per liter.\n-This price increase follows President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s controversial elimination of fuel subsidies after taking office in May 2023.\n-Gasoline prices, which were previously below 200 naira per liter, have tripled due to this policy, implemented to lessen the financial strain on the state.\n-The Tinubu-led administration hopes to attract long-term foreign investments despite the significant immediate effects on disposable income.\n-The country, which already faces a high unemployment rate and widespread poverty, could witness a rise in social unrest in the coming months.",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "The World Bank has lauded the reforms led by the Central Bank Governor, Yemi Cardoso, noting that his monetary policies are steering the country in the right direction.\n\nIndermit Gill, Senior Vice President of the World Bank Group, made this statement during the 30th Nigerian Economic Summit organized by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group on Monday in Abuja.\n\nGill commended the CBN governor for his approach to managing inflation, pointing out the 850 basis point increase in interest rates over nine months.\n\nHe emphasized that implementing such comprehensive reforms requires a strong commitment from the political leadership of the country.\n\n“Implementing such a far-reaching reform is impossible without a solid political commitment from the top. The price of PMS has quadrupled since the subsidy cut, imposing terrible hardship across the breadth of Nigeria’s society.  \n\n“The Central Bank has had to hike its policy by a huge 850 basis point, almost 9 percentage points in the last month to boost confidence in the naira and anchor inflationary expectations.  \n\n“The Central Bank financing of fiscal deficit has finally ended, and Governor Cardoso has been putting Nigeria or helping to put Nigeria on the right course,” Gill said. \n\nNigeria must stay the course\n\nSpeaking further, the World Bank noted that Nigeria has to stay the course for there to be a meaningful return and reward on the lives of the citizens.\n\nGill said it will take the country at least 15 years before the policies begin to bear fruits and make Nigeria a global engine in the Sub-Saharan African region.\n\nHe added that this is how countries such as India, Poland, Norway and others achieve economic development and transformation.\n\n“But this is only the beginning, Nigeria will need to stay the course for at least 10 to 17 years to transform its economy. If it does that, it will transform its economy.  \n\n“And it will become an engine of growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. And he will help to transform Sub-Saharan Africa. It’s very difficult to do these things, but the rewards are massive.  \n\n“This is the lesson from the last forty years as well as the experience of countries such as India, Poland, Korea and Norway,” Gill said. \n\nWhat you should know\n\nNairametrics reported that as of July 2024, only 36.3% of Nigerian households supported raising interest rates as a measure to control inflation.\n\n-The survey further showed that 50.6% of respondents favored a reduction in interest rates despite rising inflation, while 13.1% were undecided.\n-This division highlights the challenge faced by the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in balancing inflation control with public demand for lower borrowing costs.\n-Under Yemi Cardoso’s leadership, the CBN’s MPC has implemented five interest rate hikes. The initial increase raised the rate from 18.75% to 22.25%, followed by further hikes to 24.75%, 26.25%, and a 50 basis point increase to 26.75% in July 2024.\n-Most recently, the MPC raised the rate by another 50 basis points, bringing it to 27.25%.\n-These hikes, which total more than 800 basis points since Cardoso’s tenure began, are aimed at addressing Nigeria’s persistent inflation issues, particularly high core and food inflation.",

   "source": "Business & Financial Times",
   "Content": "Financial sector stakeholders have expressed optimism following Moody’s recent upgrade of the country’s credit rating, viewing it as a positive sign for the nation’s economic recovery and future growth prospects.\n\nOn October 11, 2024, Moody’s Ratings upgraded Ghana’s long-term local and foreign currency issuer ratings to Caa2 from Caa3 and Ca respectively, while also changing the outlook to positive from stable.\n\nThis marks Ghana’s first rating upgrade since February 2022, signalling a potential turning-point in the country’s financial standing.\n\nMinister of Finance Dr. Mohammed Amin Adam hailed the upgrade as a significant milestone in Ghana’s economic journey.\n\nHe emphasised that this development, coupled with Fitch Ratings’ recent positive assessment, underscores the success of Ghana’s comprehensive debt treatment and ongoing economic reforms.\n\nDr. Adam stated: “This upgrade resulted from the completion of Ghana’s comprehensive debt treatment, which provided meaningful relief to government finances. As the first substantive upgrade on our credit rating, it comes on the heels of Fitch Ratings’ assignment of Ghana’s new USD bonds a ‘CCC+’ rating and upgrade of the Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating to ‘CCC+’ from ‘CCC’.”\n\nFinance Minister Adam highlighted the country’s impressive economic rebound, noting: “Ghana’s growth has impressively rebounded this year, rising from 4.7 percent in the first quarter to 6.9 percent for the second quarter, surpassing post-debt restructuring episodes of growth projections. Inflation has halved from the pre-debt restructuring days and our debt is on a declining path, with a reduction of almost 7-percentage points of GDP.”\n\nDr. Adam assured the public of government’s continued commitment to reform, stating: “Lessons from the painful debt restructuring exercises and the sacrifice of all Ghanaians continue to spur us on to consolidate all gains through our strong reform agenda, characterised by fiscal discipline, institutional reforms and an emphasis on growth through small and medium scale enterprises”.\n\nMoody’s cited Ghana’s extensive debt treatment as the primary driver for its upgrade, which has provided substantial relief to government finances. The rating agency noted: “Debt restructuring, along with the debt service moratorium imposed during the negotiation period, has reduced government’s debt burden from a peak 93 percent of GDP in 2022 to an expected 81 percent for 2024”.\n\nThe positive outlook reflects potential for further improvement, with Moody’s stating: “Should the risk factors mentioned above dissipate, Ghana’s rating could migrate to a higher level”.\n\nAnalysts in the financial sector have also weighed in on the implications of this upgrade. Kofi Kyei Busia, an analyst at the Young Investors Network (YIN), expressed modest optimism about the potential for further rating upgrades by other agencies reflecting the improvement in Ghana’s financial standing.\n\nHe stated: “I firmly believe that Moody’s upgrade is a significant step forward – and we can expect other rating agencies to follow suit in the near future. The credit rating of a country is essentially a commentary on the perceived ability of a sovereign to service its debt; and with Ghana demonstrating fiscal discipline and progress in debt restructuring, there is every reason to expect that Fitch, Standard & Poor’s and others will take similar actions. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about trust – trust that Ghana is on a path to recovery and financial responsibility.\n\n“However, while this upgrade is promising, it’s crucial to remain cautious. Translating this positive outlook into tangible market benefits – such as renewed investor interest, lower borrowing costs and enhanced access to capital – will depend on how we manage the risks still ahead.\n\nInvestors will want to see consistency in fiscal reform, inflation control and sustained economic growth. If Ghana can maintain this momentum, I am optimistic that we will see stronger interest in our market, paving the way for more favourable economic conditions.”\n\nThe Bank of Ghana already had built sufficient reserves – reported at US$7.5billion or 3.4 months of import cover – by the end of August 2024 to support government’s debt servicing obligations While the upgrade is seen as a positive development, challenges remain.\n\nMoody’s cautioned about potential risks including: “The resumption of debt service payments, fiscal risks in the run-up to the December elections, potential negative pressure on the currency as well as reliance on expensive short-term debt represent still-elevated liquidity risk, constraining the rating”.\n\nThe upgrade comes as the nation continues to implement reforms under its IMF programme, which is expected to further strengthen policy credibility and improve access to low-cost funding from official sector sources.",

In 2024, the real GDP growth of 27 countries in the region is expected to accelerate, and eight of these countries are posting growth greater than 5.0%—notably, Côte d’Ivoire (6.5%), Senegal (6.1%), Uganda (6%, and Tanzania (5.4%), among others.”\n\n“A closer look at the past 10 years merits asking whether growth prospects in Sub-Saharan Africa have improved. If so, how many countries in the region have surpassed their pre-pandemic levels of growth of real GDP per capita?”, it questioned.\n\n Nearly 40% of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (19 of 47) registered positive growth per capita in 2016–19 and 2022–25, and are outperforming their pre-pandemic performance.\n\nTen of these countries have annual average growth rates per capita that exceed 3% per year in 2022–25—notably, —notably, Benin, Kenya, Mauritania, Mauritius, Rwanda, and Senegal.\n\nGrowth Per Capita Decreasing in Ghana\n\nMeanwhile, growth per capita in Ghana and Guinea is decelerating by more than 2 percentage points in 2022–24.\n\nAlso, growth per capita in the largest countries in the region—Nigeria and South Africa—remains below 1.0% per year, despite showing a slight improvement compared to the pre-pandemic period.",

   "source": "Ghana Web",
   "Content": "The Dangote refinery is set to meet with the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) on Tuesday with regards to a topic that has been on the lips of concerned Nigerians.\n\nBoth parties are set to discuss the viability of a decrease in Dangote’s fuel price compared to the country’s current price.\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Marketers Association Of Nigeria (IPMAN) alongside the Dangote refinery is set to finalize agreements on the cost of lifting petrol from the refinery. IPMAN predicts the move would contribute to the stability and efficiency of Nigeria's fuel supply chain.\n\nThis is following the government’s decision to give the Dangote refinery and marketers the liberty to determine the price they intend to charge the market.\n\nLast week, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), decided to hands off from the operations of Dangote’s refinery.\n\nThis was done in order to allow fuel pricing be determined by market forces as defined by the Dangote refinery and marketers.\n\nAs reported by the Punch newspaper, IPMAN's National Publicity Secretary, Chinedu Ukadike, gave an update on this new development on Sunday, stating that the group is ready to begin a positive business relationship with the refinery and wanted to meet with executives of the Dangote refinery for a discussion.\n\n“We hope to sit down with Dangote maybe Tuesday or Wednesday and if they give us a template or price, we will move to Dangote. I want to reassure you that we have all it takes to off-take whatever Dangote will give to us. I don’t know why they are dragging their legs to discuss with marketers, maybe it is politics,” the publicity secretary stated.\n\n“The more we take action in terms of distribution lines, the price will come down, we are not afraid of this competition, we have organized ourselves and are ready to compete because this is the survival of the fittest,” he added.\n\nPetrol pricing\n\nWhen asked about the pricing of petrol in the near future, President of the Petroleum Products Retail Outlets Owners Association of Nigeria (PETROAN), Billy Gillis-Harry, noted that the price could drop to N700.\n\nCurrently, the price of petrol in Nigeria ranges from N1000 to N1500, following a recent hike in the product’s price.\n\n“The price can be knocked down to N700/litre; it depends on the volatility of the market and this does not always mean upward prices, it could also mean prices coming down,” the PETROAN boss stated.\n\n“If we have massive supply and there are a lot of products in Nigeria, obviously everybody will be looking for just minimal profit. Our business is focused on turnover, so people may cut prices down,” he added.\n\nLast week, it was reported that fuel stations owned by independent marketers were adjusting their prices, with many crossing the N1,000 per litre threshold.\n\nIn the country's capital; Abuja, the petrol pump price rose to N1,030 per litre at various NNPC outlets, while in the commercial center Lagos, the price increased to N998 per litre.",

   "source": "Ghana Web",
   "Content": "Gold prices are on track to reach historic levels in the first quarter of 2025, predicts the CEO of one of the world’s largest independent financial advisory and asset management organizations.\n\nThe bullish prediction from deVere Group’s Nigel Green is driven by a confluence of factors reshaping global markets.\n\nHe says: “As central banks continue aggressive buying, the US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, and geopolitical tensions persist, the precious metal is primed for a bullish surge that could shatter previous records.”\n\nCentral banks around the world are accelerating their gold purchases at a pace not seen in decades. This trend, which initially gained momentum following the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, has broadened, with many countries shifting away from US dollar-denominated assets.\n\n“Gold buying has now surged to nearly three times the level it was before 2022, and the outlook suggests continued strong demand into 2025,” notes the deVere CEO.\n\n“This wave of buying is not just about portfolio diversification — it’s a strategic move to mitigate risks. Countries, especially those wary of US financial sanctions, are increasingly turning to gold to shield their reserves from political and economic pressures.\"\n\n“China, for instance, has been a key player in this trend. In 2023, China’s central bank added to its gold holdings for 10 consecutive months, underscoring the nation’s intention to reduce its reliance on the dollar amidst growing geopolitical tensions with the West.\"\n\n“This buying intensity continued well into 2024, with net purchases of 290 tonnes recorded in the first quarter of 2024 – the fourth strongest quarter of purchases since the buying streak began in 2022.”\n\nSimilarly, Turkey, Singapore, Brazil and India have also ramped up their gold reserves, driven by their need to safeguard against currency volatility and potential sanctions.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve’s shift from its aggressive interest rate hiking cycle toward rate cuts is another pivotal factor that will likely fuel a rally in gold.\n\n“Higher interest rates make gold less attractive as it doesn’t generate yield. However, with rates poised to fall, the tables are turning. Lower rates can often reduce the appeal of yield-bearing assets, drawing some investors – both retail and institutional – back into the gold market.”\n\nIn today’s fragile global landscape, gold’s role as a portfolio hedge remains as vital as ever. The potential for geopolitical shocks—including escalating trade wars, sanctions, and heightened global tensions—continues to loom large.\n\n“Gold offers unparalleled protection in such scenarios, especially as concerns grow around issues such as Fed independence, global debt sustainability, and financial sanctions,” affirms Nigel Green.\n\n“One scenario that could send gold prices soaring is an escalation in financial sanctions comparable to the surge seen since 2021. Another potential trigger could be worsening debt fears in the US.”\n\nHe concludes, “Against this backdrop, and should the current momentum be maintained, we could see new all-time price highs for gold in the first quarter of 2025.”",

The primary causes of these closures are linked to a lack of training and limited access to finance.\n\nThe two-day Big Baraza Annual Conference gathered over 500 entrepreneurs and business owners from across the country.

   "source": "Business & Financial Times",
   "Content": "The Ghana Standards Authority (GSA) is intensifying calls for introducing a new law that will mandate the use of ISO-14001, an environmental management framework, across all mining operations as part of the country’s fight against illegal mining.\n\nThis proposal aims to enforce sustainable mining practices and limit environmental degradation, which is on the rise due to widespread activities of illegal miners in the country.\n\nGSA’s Director-General, Prof. Alex Dodoo – speaking during the World Standards Day observance in Accra, stressed the need for stricter governance in the mining sector.\n\nHe noted that although the ISO-14001 series is currently available to guide sustainable operations, compliance remains voluntary – creating what he described as a “gap” in environmental governance.\n\n“We are pushing very hard to ensure that all companies working in the mining and related areas will be certified to the International Standards that guarantee environmental sustainability – the ISO-14001 series,” said Prof. Dodoo.\n\n“We want this to be mandatory, because then companies will be required to implement systems that promote the environment.”\n\nThe GSA chief further explained that the ISO-14001 standard’s voluntary nature has limited its impact in curbing environmental harm caused by mining activities.\n\n“Currently, these standards exist but are not mandatory on the industry, and that is a gap we hope to close.”  He was therefore hopeful that the GSA could work closely with its supervisory ministry – Ministry of Trade and Industry – and the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources to make these standards compulsory.\n\nIllegal mining has been a persistent issue in recent years, with devastating effects on rivers, forests and local communities beginning to manifest.\n\nGovernment efforts to clamp down on the practice have faced challenges, including poor enforcement and governance loopholes – leading to Organised Labour recently threatening to ‘shutdown’ the country with its now suspended nationwide strike action .\n\nIt is given this that the proposed legislation is hoped will compel mining companies to obtain certification under the ISO-14001 series, which requires firms to implement, monitor and continually improve environmental management systems.\n\nFurthermore, he said, the GSA has developed standards for packaging materials including plastics.\n\nThis year’s World Standards Day celebration focuses on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 (which calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impact) and amplifies the calls for SDG standards.\n\nOn the back of this, Prof. Dodoo said the GSA is committed to providing their expertise, also relying on their advanced laboratories, and called on players in all sectors of the country to partner with them to ensure Ghana becomes a country where sustainable development is a reality.\n\nEach year on 14 October, members of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU) celebrate World Standards Day. This is aimed at paying tribute to the collaborative efforts of thousands of experts worldwide who develop the voluntary technical agreements that are published as International Standards.\n\nThe 2024 celebration was observed in Ghana under the theme ‘Shared Vision for a Better World: Standards for the Changing Climate’.\n\nBoard Chairman-GSA, Prof. Mills Robertson, also speaking at the ceremony noted that climate change is not a distant challenge but one that affects all aspects of life – from the air we breathe to the products we use daily, adding that the role of standards has never been more critical in addressing these global issues.\n\n“At GSA, our laboratories conduct tests on various products that have both direct and indirect implications on the climate. Whether it’s testing emissions from industrial equipment or evaluating the sustainability of agricultural inputs, our work helps ensure that Ghana’s industries are aligned with global standards that prioritise the health of our environment.”\n\nHe said the observance serves as “a reminder of the shared responsibility we all hold, not just as individuals but as organisations, industries and nations, to set and adhere to standards that foster resilience and adaptability in the face of climate change”.\n\nAdditionally, Director of Standards-GSA, Regina Vowotor, added that given the growing challenges posed by climate change, GSA is committed to raising awareness on how standards can drive sustainable practices, improve resilience and support mitigation efforts.\n\n“By highlighting SDG 13, we aim to showcase the crucial role that standards play in addressing climate-related issues, promoting environmental responsibility and guiding industries toward more sustainable and climate-conscious practices.”.",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "The Nigerian telecom sector has seen an improvement in foreign direct investments this year as it attracted a total of $304 million in the first six months of this year.\n\nGoing by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data, the sector has more than doubled the $134.75 capital importation recorded in the full year 2023 with the six-month record of 2024.\n\nThis is coming after years of consistent decline in investments even with a gaping infrastructure gap requiring billions of investments to bridge.\n\nThe NBS data showed that the sector attracted a $191.5 million capital inflow in the first quarter of this year, marking a significant 769% increase compared with $22.05 million received in Q1 2023.\n\nIn Q2 2024, FDIs in the sector stood at $113.4 million. While this is lower than the inflow recorded in the preceding quarter, it represents a whopping 339% increase over the $25.81 capital inflow recorded in the same period last year.\n\nNo cause for celebration yet\n\nHowever, stakeholders in the telecom sector are not excited by the development yet. According to them, a lot still needs to be done by the government on the policy front to sustain the current trend and reverse the losses of the past years.\n\nSpecifically, Mr.Wale Babalola, a consultant in the telecoms market, reported investments in the first six months of the year are still quite insignificant to drive the growth sector currently needs.\n\n“Yes, it’s good that the sector is doing better than last year and to an extent, the last two years, but that is not enough to bridge the existing infrastructure in the sector.  \n\n“Besides, many investors are still watching to see how the government will handle several policy issues still hanging. one of which is tariff regulation. Any country that wants to attract investors should be able to assure returns on investments.  \n\nI don’t think that exists right now in the telecom market with the regulator preventing the telecom operators from reviewing their pricing to adjust for inflation and the rising operating costs,” he said.\n\nFor the Executive Secretary of the Association of Licensed Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ALTON), Mr Gbolahan, Awonuga, the issue of forex instability is still a major problem that needs to be addressed to encourage more investments in the telecom sector.\n\n“Whatever we are seeing now may be a flash in the pan until the industry challenges are addressed. Issues of Right of Way charges are still there, likewise multiple taxation and above all the forex instability that continues to affect the operators’ ability to import equipment,” he said.\n\n- The CEO of Digital Reality and immediate past President of the Association of Telecommunications Company of Nigeria (ATCON) Engr. Ikechukwu Nnamani hopes that the government will make the industry attractive by creating a very conducive and stable environment.\n\n- According to him, a stable environment would mean that the government is consistent with its policies. Nnamani also observed that instability in the country’s forex market has been a major discouragement for many foreign investors who are interested in the country’s telecoms.\n\nRecords of investment decline \n\nThe telecom industry report for 2022 published last year by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) shows that total investment inflow to the industry in that year stood at $399.9 billion.\n\n- This represents a 47% decline when compared with the $753 million recorded in 2021.\n\n- While the $753 million recorded in 2021 came as an increase compared with $417.4 million recorded in the preceding year, the growth came as a result of the effect COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which saw economic activities reduced drastically across the globe.\n\n- Before that, capital inflow into the telecom industry stood at $942.8 million in 2019, which made the 2021 inflow a decline, when compared with the pre-COVID-19 year.\n\n- Due to the declining investment, the operators have been slowing down their capital expenditure (CAPEX) even though maintaining telecommunications requires consistent investment in infrastructure for network expansion and optimization.\n\n- This much was confirmed in the 2022 report, which showed that the industry’s CAPEX declined by 30% in the year.\n\n- According to the report, the operators spent a total of N785 billion as CAPEX in 2022 compared with N1.1 trillion in 2021.\n\nGovernment in search of $2 billion for telecom infrastructure  \n\nMeanwhile, realizing that investments into the sector have not been coming it ought to be, the government is now spearheading a national fibre project aimed at bridging the infrastructure gap and enhancing broadband access across the country.\n\n- This followed the government’s launching of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the delivery of an additional 90,000km of fibre optic cable to complement existing connectivity for universal access to the internet.\n\n- According to the Minister of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy, Dr. Bosun Tijani, the government has been in talks with financiers including the World Bank to bring the fibre project to reality.\n\n- It is unclear yet how soon the funding will come but the Minister in a recent media chat hinted that the delivery of the project may take two to three years.",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "The Nigerian naira has plummeted to a new record low, closing at N1,700 per dollar in the parallel market on October 14, 2024, according to data from Bureau de Change (BDC) operators.\n\nThis represents a 0.29% drop from its previous rate of N1,695/$1 recorded on October 11, despite a surge in crude oil prices, which have surpassed $80 per barrel.\n\nWhile the naira weakened in the parallel market, it remained relatively stable in the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window, closing at N1,641.27/$1. However, this still marks a 1.14% depreciation from its previous rate of N1,622.57/$1.\n\nThe widening gap between the official and parallel market rates continues to reflect the broader economic pressures on Nigeria’s foreign exchange system.\n\nMarket Trends\n\nThe naira has faced sustained depreciation throughout 2024, losing over 50% of its value since the start of the year. Back in January, the currency traded at N907.11/$1, but by October, it had breached the N1,500/$1 mark. The naira reached a record low of N1,616.53/$1 in February before a brief rally in March saw it recover to N1,303/$1.\n\nBy early April, the currency had slipped below N1,100/$1, continuing its downward trajectory. It closed at N1,668.97/$1 by the end of September, and its recent drop into the N1,700 range marks the naira’s weakest level to date.\n\nKey data points \n\n- On October 14, 2024, the naira opened at N1,695 per dollar in the parallel market but slipped to N1,700/$1, marking a 0.29% decline.\n\n- In the I&E window, the currency closed at N1,641.27/$1 on October 11, down by 1.15% from the previous day’s rate of N1,622.57/$1.\n\n- During trading in the I&E window, the naira saw significant volatility, reaching a high of N1,675.00/$1 and a low of N1,591.00/$1, before settling at N1,641.27/$1.\n\n- Trading volumes surged significantly in the I&E window, reaching $616.73 million, compared to just $145.56 million the previous day, indicating increased activity and dollar demand.\n\nKey factors at play\n\nNigeria’s exchange rate crisis is being driven by several macroeconomic factors. Despite higher global oil prices, which typically bolster foreign exchange inflows for oil-dependent economies like Nigeria, the naira continues to weaken. The persistent pressure on the currency is likely being exacerbated by dollar shortages, inflation, and a reliance on the parallel market for foreign exchange.\n\nNotably, Nigerian crude is still trading above $80 per barrel, despite concerns over weaker energy demand from China. Meanwhile, James Tor, National Secretary of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), has suggested that petrol prices could decline.\n\nThis follows the federal government’s decision to allow marketers to purchase fuel directly from the Dangote refinery and other suppliers, which may reduce import dependency.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nDespite the naira’s recent breach of the N1,700/$1 threshold, there is potential for a short-term recovery. Rising global oil prices, now above $81 per barrel, may help ease some of the inflationary pressures plaguing the economy, fostering a more positive sentiment around the naira.\n\nAdditionally, new economic policies designed to curb demand for foreign exchange could offer further support for the currency, allowing it to return to the N1,600/$1 range in the coming days. However, the overall trajectory of the naira will remain closely tied to the broader macroeconomic environment, including inflationary trends and foreign currency supply.\n\nAs Nigeria navigates through these challenges, the effectiveness of policy responses will be crucial in determining whether the naira can stabilize or if further depreciation is on the horizon.",

   "Content": "The Federal Government of Nigeria, through the Debt Management Office (DMO), is seeking to raise N180 billion from the bond market in October 2024.\n\nNairametrics observed that this is an increase of 20% from the N150 billion offered in the previous month.\n\nThis upward revision reflects the government’s continued efforts to finance key projects and manage its fiscal obligations through the bond market.\n\nBreakdown of bond offers\n\nAccording to the bond offer circular released by the DMO, two re-openings of previously issued bonds are being auctioned.\n\nThe first bond is the N90 billion 19.30% FGN APR 2029 (5-year reopening), while the second is the N90 billion 18.50% FGN FEB 2031 (7-year reopening).\n\nBoth bonds will be auctioned on October 21, 2024, with settlement set for October 23, 2024.\n\nThe units of sale are pegged at N1,000 per unit, with a minimum subscription requirement of N50,001,000.\n\nInvestors are required to bid in multiples of N1,000 beyond the minimum threshold. These bonds offer semi-annual interest payments and are structured for bullet repayment at maturity.\n\nThe bonds are considered secure investments as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the Federal Government of Nigeria and are charged upon the general assets of Nigeria.\n\nAlso, they qualify as securities in which trustees can invest under the Trustee Investment Act and are exempt from taxes for pension funds, among other investors, under the Company Income Tax Act (CITA) and Personal Income Tax Act (PITA).\n\nIn addition to these tax benefits, the bonds are listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited and FMDQ OTC Securities Exchange.\n\nAll FGN Bonds also qualify as liquid assets for banks when calculating liquidity ratios, making them an attractive option for financial institutions.\n\nInterested investors are directed to approach any of the accredited Primary Dealer Market Makers (PDMMs), which include leading financial institutions such as Access Bank Plc, First Bank of Nigeria Ltd, Stanbic IBTC Bank Ltd, Citibank Nigeria Ltd, and others.\n\nWhat you should know\n\nThe Nigerian Federal Government raised N264.527 billion at its September bond auction.\n\nThe auction, held on September 23, 2024, reopened three tranches of Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) bonds: the 19.30% FGN APR 2029 (5-year bond), the 18.50% FGN FEB 2031 (7-year bond), and the 19.89% FGN MAY 2033 (9-year bond).\n\nTotal subscriptions were at N414.881 billion in September, and the amount allotted was N264.527 billion.\n\nDespite the lower allotment in September, the results indicate sustained demand, particularly for longer-dated instruments.\n\nAlso, in the September bond auction, the marginal rates across all bond tenors were lower compared to the previous month’s rates.\n\nThe reduction in the rate suggests that the government was able to secure funding at a slightly lower cost, which could help reduce debt servicing obligations.",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "The Federal government is looking at imposing a 25% tax rate on individuals earning N100 million and above monthly in the country.\n\nThe Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms, Taiwo Oyedele stated this at a breakout session during the Nigeria Economic Summit organised by the NESG.\n\nHe also noted that those who earn over N100 million monthly that is the rich should pay a 25% tax.\n \nOyedele explained that the 25% tax on the rich was needed to strike a balance that eases the tax burden on low-income earners while ensuring that higher-income individuals contribute more to government revenue.\n\nHe also stated the federal government plans to pay back to businesses 100% of the Value Added Tax (VAT) paid by them on assets and services.\n\nAccording to him, businesses paying VAT on assets such as cars, laptops etc increases their overall cost which contributes to inflation.\n\nHe said, “If you earn N1.5 million a month or less, your personal income tax bill will go down. At the lower end, it is completely exempted. But if you earn more than that amount, you see it going up incrementally up to 25%.\n\n“Today, if you earn N100 million a month, it is a 19% effective Personal Income Tax (PIT) rate, we are taking that up to 25% for the rich people and that is because we need to balance the books.”\n\nIt is expected that this proposal would enable companies to deduct the VAT paid on goods and services used in production from their tax liabilities, potentially alleviating cash flow challenges and boosting economic activity.\n\nRecent tax reform proposals and changes\n\nThe Taiwo Oyedele Chaired Committee has proposed a range of fiscal measures aimed at increasing government revenues while alleviating the tax burden on businesses and stimulating economic activities.\n\nSome of their proposals and approved changes so far include; a new withholding tax regime which exempts manufacturers and small businesses from paying withholding tax, a proposal to exclude food and transport from taxes, the introduction of Tax ID for bankers and those who work in the financial services sector etc.\n\nCurrently, the committee has sent ten new bills to the National Assembly on constitutional changes to the nation’s tax laws.\n\nThe committee pointed out that some of the identified issues require legislative amendments, rather than just executive orders.\n\nWhat this means\n\nNigeria operates a progressive personal income tax system, often referred to as “Pay As You Earn” (PAYE), where tax rates increase with income levels. Under this system, taxpayers first receive a 20% tax-free allowance, after which taxes are levied on a sliding scale.\n\nFor instance, the first N25,000 monthly net income is taxed at 7%, and the rates continue to rise until reaching a maximum of 24% for net incomes above N133k monthly.\n\nThis structure results in an effective tax rate that is lower than the highest marginal rate of 24%. Currently, Nigerians earning over N100 million annually pay an effective tax rate of around 18%\n\nHowever, a proposed adjustment to the tax system aims to increase the effective tax rate for high-income earners to 25%, ensuring a more substantial contribution from wealthy Nigerians.",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "The last figures I saw showed inflation, particularly food inflation, inching close to 40%, while other headline inflation rates were averaging in the late 30s.\n\nI wonder why nobody is talking about a recession. Things weren’t this bad during Buhari’s time when we readily announced that we had entered a recession.\n\nToday, the economy is flat. The main economic drivers—fuel prices and forex—seem to have taken on a life of their own, escalating at alarming rates.\n\nGovernment spending is spiralling out of control, and a recent trend of non-elected individuals with close ties to the government donating huge sums is showcasing the profligacy that appears to be fueling this spending.\n\nBut wait, this situation has also unveiled less obvious, but impactful, “tiny devils”—replacement costs and fear. They feed into each other.\n\nThe lack of government sincerity and coherence has led to a widespread lack of confidence in its ability to tackle issues at all levels of economic activity, resulting in a fear of replacement costs taking over.\n\nThe weakening of economic discipline has caused even the smallest players to mark up their prices beyond normal market forces, to ensure they aren’t stranded when it comes time to replace goods or services or to afford other skyrocketing essentials.\n\nHere are three examples at the micro level:\n\nI needed to change my eyeglass frames, so I took two pairs to an optician at the military hospital and one to a roadside vendor.\n\nBefore Tinubu, the average price for this service would have been around N1,000 or less, but the optician charged N12,000 for two pairs, and the roadside vendor took N25,000 for one.\n\nDo you see the fear at play?\n\nNext, I needed batteries for my car keys. The dealership technician told me to buy them from a supermarket for N2,000, but since I didn’t have time, I asked him to help. He charged me N25,000, citing transportation costs and the need to sync them with their machine.\n\nLastly, my inverter fuse blew due to an overload. The fuse itself should cost no more than N5,000, but I was charged N35,000.\n\nWhat am I getting at here? The reported 40% inflation rate could be discounted by as much as 20% if you factor in this psychological element. Out of fear, prices are being inflated to maintain buying power and ensure affordability for other goods and services, which are also rising.\n\nThis fear is rooted in a loss of confidence in the government, which during its honeymoon period and beyond, introduced a series of inconsistent policies that signaled an inability to handle the economy effectively. This loss of confidence has led to widespread indiscipline, affecting the pricing of goods and services.\n\nThe government should urgently remove vested interests from policy formulation, especially in policies affecting major economic drivers like fuel and forex.\n\nA transparent approach would restore the stability needed to encourage proper planning and economic discipline.\n\nThis is crucial if we want to restore sanity to the economic space. But the looming question remains: does the government have the political will and internal capacity to push for this?\n\nLet me stop here.\n\nDuke of Shomolu",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "The World Bank has said Nigeria was losing around N10 trillion in foregone revenue to fuel subsidy and multiple exchanges as of 2022 before the implementation of President Tinubu’s reforms.\n\nThe Senior Vice President of the World Bank Group, Indermit Gill, made this disclosure during the ongoing 30th Nigerian Economic Summit, organised by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group and the Ministry of Budget and National Planning on Monday in Abuja.\n\nGill said the country lost about N5.2 trillion or 3% of its GDP to the pegging of exchange rate alone in 2022; he also added that PMS subsidy gulped about N4.5 trillion in the same year.\n \nAccording to him, altogether these two forms of subsidy resulted in a total of a staggering N10 trillion or $15 billion in the same year.\n\n“Let me briefly take each one of these in turn to show you how much oil wealth has been squandered in the past, the very recent past. Last year before the reforms, the official rate was roughly N455/$. The freely determined parallel rate at that time was close to N700, meaning that for every dollar allocated at the official rate, the loss to the government was close to N250, every dollar.  \n\n“The total loss in foregone revenue of oil, custom import duties and taxes amounted to N5.2 trillion in 2022. This was more than 3% of GDP. You can do a lot with 3% of $300 billion.  \n\n“Now, the cost of subsidizing PMS and keeping its price below market level amounted to N5.7 trillion in 2022. That was another 2% of GDP. You can do a lot with 2% of GDP. Together, these two subsidies—the implicit one from the exchange rate and the explicit PMS subsidy—amounted to a staggering N10 trillion a year by 2022 or $15 billion at the free market exchange rate. You can do a lot with $15 billion,” Gill said.\n\nNigeria is on the brink of Collapse\n\nThe World Bank also noted that the country was on the brink of collapse before the introduction of the critical reforms of removal of subsidy and exchange rate unification.\n\nThe senior vice president of the Brentwood Institution observed that the Central Bank was only printing billions in ways and means advances to offset the cost of pegging the naira and explicit cost of fuel subsidy.\n\nAccording to him, he said these previous policies resulted in about 35% per cent tax on non-oil exports, including manufacturing and agriculture.\n\n“By the way, these were just a direct fiscal cost. The wider cost may have been even greater. They included a huge implicit tax amounting to 37 per cent on non-oil exports, including manufacturing and agriculture.\n\n“Ways and means advances became the primary way of financing the government to offset the cost of exchange rate and PMS subsidy, this meant inflation of course.  \n\nAs a result, debt service consumed all revenues by 2022, and the public debt was burgeoning. Nigeria was on the brink of a full-blown crisis and collapse in the confidence of the naira,” Gill added.\n\nWhat you should know  \n\n- Upon assuming office, President Bola Tinubu initiated comprehensive reforms aimed at restructuring Nigeria’s fiscal environment. Key among these reforms was the removal of the petrol subsidy and the consolidation of the multiple exchange rate regimes.\n\n- According to President Tinubu, these past policies had not only drained national revenue but also stifled investment.\n\n- However, since the implementation of these reforms, the cost of living has surged, with inflation rising above 30%.\n\n- Fuel prices have also soared, with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) adjusting pump prices to N998 in Lagos and N1,030 in Abuja.",

   "source": "BusinessDay",
   "Content": "The World Bank has projected that Nigeria’s revenue-to-GDP ratio could rise to over 10.5 percent by the end of 2024, following the recent increase in government revenue.\n\nThe Nigerian government recently reported a 100 percent rise in revenue to N9.1 trillion in the first half of 2024, compared to the same period last year.\n\nNdiamé Diop, World Bank country director for Nigeria shared this forecast during an interactive session on ‘Fiscal Reforms for a More Secure Future’ at the 30th Nigerian Economic Summit.\n\nHe urged the federal government to sustain key reforms such as the unification of foreign exchange rates and the removal of fuel subsidies.\n\n“Revenue has been increasing quite significantly and we are seeing a significant increase in revenue. We are talking a large amount bigger than the fuel subsidy. The digital reform to increase tax compliance is bearing fruits”, he said.\n\nHe emphasised that Nigeria had previously ranked among the lowest in the world in terms of revenue-to-GDP ratio.\n\nBefore President Bola Tinubu’s administration introduced reforms, he said the country’s debt servicing in 2022 consumed 100 percent of its revenue, with public expenditure amounting to 12.9 percent of GDP.\n\nHowever, only 7.6 percent of that expenditure was covered by government revenue, reflecting the weak revenue-to-GDP ratio.\n\n“There was mostly a fiscal deficit, which means debt. You cannot do that year in, year out, without facing a crisis. I think this is really why fiscal reforms are important”, Diop said.\n\nHe explained that relying on debt to fund public spending is unsustainable, especially when revenue remains low. “As debt levels rise, particularly through expensive commercial loans, the burden of debt servicing rises very high.”\n\nDiop stressed that without comprehensive fiscal reforms, public spending needs will continue to grow, and persistent fiscal deficits could destabilise the economy.\n\nIn his remarks, Wale Edun, the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, said the government aims to boost food production to address inflation in the short term.\n\n“We are focusing on increasing food production to reduce inflation. The objective is to make food more accessible, and affordable, and thereby ease the cost of living for Nigerians,” Edun stated.\n\nHe outlined government investments for the current planting season, explaining, “During the dry season, we aim to engage one million smallholder farmers, providing them with seeds, fertilisers, and herbicides.”\n\n“This initiative is expected to yield approximately five million tonnes of grains, with an average output of five tonnes per hectare. This should help mitigate inflation, particularly in the short term.”\n\nEdun also highlighted the government’s collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB) to establish agricultural processing zones. These zones will support domestic industries by ensuring a steady supply of raw materials.",

   "source": "BusinessDay",
   "Content": "Stakeholders in Nigeria’s infrastructure sector are urging the federal government to harness private sector funding for infrastructural development.\n\nThey said current revenue from the public sector was insufficient to bridge the infrastructure gap in Nigeria.\n\nThey made the call during a panel discussion at the ongoing Nigerian Economic Summit titled; “Accelerating Infrastructure Development” in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nExperts however identified a lack of transparency in public procurement processes as a significant obstacle hindering investment from the private sector.\n\nJobson Ewalefoh, director general of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission, highlighted that private sector involvement is essential for accelerating infrastructure growth and achieving government objectives.\n\n“We have a lot of infrastructure gaps in Nigeria across different sectors. Be it transportation, energy, health, housing and so on. But the present revenue of the government may not take us to where we want to be,” Ewalefoh said.\n\n“We need to put on our thinking hat and re-strategize. This made me think, the only way we can bridge the infrastructure gap in this country at this current rate, is to harness the private sector funding,” he explained.\n\n“We also need a shift of mindset that the government can provide all the infrastructure needs we have. The private sector funding will unlock the infrastructure development we need.”\n\nEwalefoh noted that Nigeria must follow models from other countries who have gotten it right to ensure it meets the infrastructure goals. He cited Rwanda as one of the countries in Africa at about 7.2 growth rate.\n\nHe also proposed that Nigeria develop the right framework.\n\nOyebode Oyetunde, executive director of the African Development Bank, noted that one of the key things Nigeria needs was to connect the ecosystem, emphasising that collaboration between the private and public sectors is required to achieve greater results in execution of any meaningful infrastructure project execution.\n\nAccording to him, good governance and transparency are crucial for instilling investors’ confidence.\n\n“We need an ecosystem approach, and we have to learn the discipline of exploring and working hard to see what we need to pass on to the ecosystem as a whole.”\n\n“We need to have an ecosystem. We have systems in different places, but when you connect them you create an ecosystem. And if you connect them enough, then you can see real transformation.”\n\n“But if you don’t have sufficient connections and the parts of the systems are not strong enough, you won’t see transformation, even though you have almost everything. Sometimes with Nigeria, as you were saying, the solutions are not simple because our problems are complex.”\n\nHe urged the country to use private sector finance to fund public infrastructures, noting that the system is broken which is fuelling rising costs.\n\nDele Sotumbo, CEO of Stanbic IBTC Capital Limited, said for Nigeria to solve its infrastructure problems, governments at all levels must ensure transparency in all their transaction processes.\n\nHe argued that lack of non-transparency has over the years scared investors away and insisted that without a commitment to transparent processes, the potential for private sector funding will remain untapped.\n\nHe emphasised that if the government fails to do things right, funding will never come.\n\n“Government, the federal or state, if not local government, lack the financial muscle to push infrastructure through, Hence, all that we’ve been speaking about over the years as to how we attract the private sector funding into infrastructure development in Nigeria.”\n\n“Our problem is not lack of plans. If we are going to solve this problem in Nigeria, yes we have beautiful plans, but let’s always insert the concept of transparency into whatever we do, because if that is lacking, forget it. We’ll only be telling stories.”",

   "Content": "Mkhululi Ncube, programmes officer at the African Minerals Development Centre, said the newly launched African Mining Vision (AMV), which focuses on integrating mining into industrial and social development, will revitalize Nigeria’s mining sector and drive broader economic transformation across the continent.\n\nHe noted that the vision will enhance local industries and foster economic growth by linking mining activities to various sectors.\n\nThe AMV, launched at the ongoing Nigerian Economic Summit on Monday in Abuja, is a private sector-led platform focused on sustainable and responsible mineral sector development based on shared benefits.\n\nIt aims to drive Nigeria’s domestication and implementation of AMV, fostering collaboration among the government, communities, and the private sector, while also establishing a partnership between the NESG and the AMDC to manage the AMV Private Sector Compact in Nigeria.\n\n“It will transform the continent’s mining sector into a catalyst for broader economic transformation, focusing on integrating mining into industrial and social development,” said Ncube.\n\n“This transformation will occur through investing in linkages, resource-based industrialisation, enhancing local content, and participation in the minerals”\n\nAccording to him “The AMV Compact aligns with mining companies’ core values, policies, strategic plans, and mission statements rather than being solely compliance-based on national legislation.”\n\nHe noted that it follows the model of the UN Global Compact, which calls on businesses across all sectors to align their strategies and operations with ten universal principles in human rights, labour, the environment, and anti-corruption.\n\nRead also: Weak reforms, policies seen stalling mining industry growth\n\nHe further noted that “Despite the Nigerian government’s efforts since 2005 to revitalise the mining sector, including modernising laws and investing in geoscience data, the industry still needs to be developed, adding that a 2023 NESG study identified four key challenges behind the mining sector’s underperformance.\n\n“They include the absence of a regulatory commission, the exclusion of sub-national governments, a misaligned exploration strategy, and weak economic linkages.”\n\n”The AMV Private-Sector Compact offers a cost-effective way for the private sector to engage with critical actors.”\n\nHe added that the engagement is essential for establishing measures that will create a thriving, transformative, and sustainable mining sector.\n\nThe sector will be designed to meet the needs of the government, society, and businesses by utilising the AMV and its instruments”",

   "source": "BusinessDay",
   "Content": "Nigerian manufacturers are clawing back on their growth and expansion plans due to cash crunch.\n\nThis is based on capital expenditure margin data from the first half of 2024 (H1 2024), analysed by BusinessDay.\n\nAccording to data tracked using the cash flow financial statements of manufacturers listed on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX), capital expenditure margins declined 2 percentage points year over year, from 10 percent as of H1 2023 to 8 percent as of H1 2024.\n\nCapital expenditure margin (capex margin) is a metric which measures how much a company is spending on capital expenditure, essentially, the acquisition of new fixed assets, relative to its revenue. The metric provides insights into a company’s investment in its long-term assets in proportion to its generated revenue.\n\nCapex margin is important because it provides a representation of how well a company is investing in its fixed assets in line with its growth and expansion plans. Essentially, when a company has a high capex margin, it depicts that the company is expanding its production capacity or upgrading its infrastructure.\n\nIt can also be used to assess the profitability potential of the company, as increased investment in long-term assets has the potential to boost revenue. When a company records low capex margins, it depicts that the company is more focused on cost management and optimisation, rather than expansion.\n\nSince 2023, soaring inflation and foreign exchange instability have placed Nigerian manufacturers in precarious operational positions, with many facing significant losses that could take years to recover. Hence, since 2023, these manufacturers have been more focused on cost management than growth and upgrading their infrastructure.\n\nIn H1 2023, the 28 companies tracked during this analysis posted gross revenue of N3.17 trillion in H1 2023. However, they spent N311.5 billion on the fixed assets addition during the period, marking a capex margin of 10 percent. As of H1 2024, these same companies posted gross revenue of N5.38 trillion, with a capital expenditure of N430.6 billion, marking a capex margin of 8 percent.\n\nAlthough there was a 38 percent year-on-year growth in the capital expenditure, it was not commensurate with the 70 percent year-on-year growth in revenue during the period.\n\nThe companies used in this analysis were drawn from across different sectors in the NGX, including industrial goods, consumer goods, agriculture, and breweries. During the half-year, BUA Cement, just like last year, posted the highest capex margin, with 23 percent. In H1 2023, BUA spent about 50 percent of its generated revenue on fixed asset additions, as the group had a capex of N110.9 billion, with a revenue of N221 billion.\n\nBUA Cement’s capex margin is down to its expansionary move, with the group currently expanding its Sokoto and Edo plants, with the aim of boosting its total capacity to 20 million tonnes per annum.\n\nPalm oil company, Presco Plc, is also on a growth move with a capex margin of 20 percent during the half-year. The company recorded a capex of N17.4 billion during the half-year, marking a 202 percent year-on-year growth from N5.8 billion capital expenditure spent in H1 2023. Since undergoing management changes, Presco has seen a significant expansion drive, evidenced with its acquisition of Ghana Oil Palm Development Company (GOPDC).\n\nCement makers, Dangote Cement and Lafarge Africa, are also spending more money on expansion. The cement industry in Nigeria has become quite competitive in recent years, with the major players, Dangote, BUA, and Lafarge expanding their production capacity at the same time. For Lafarge, the company’s fixed assets addition during the half-year was N27.8 billion, marking a 99 percent year-on-year growth from the N13.9 billion recorded in H1 2023.\n\n\nDangote Cement also spent N161.8 billion on fixed assets addition during the half-year, marking a capex margin of 9 percent. In H1 2023, the company posted a capex of N66.4 billion as well as a capex margin of 7 percent.\n\nIn terms of fixed assets addition during the half-year, Dangote Cement, BUA Cement, International Breweries, Lafarge Africa, and Nigerian Breweries posted the highest capex in H1 2024. Nestle Nigeria, Dangote Sugar Refinery, Presco, and BUA Foods completed the list of the top ten in terms of capex.",

   "source": "BusinessDay",
   "Content": "Eggs have become inaccessible for several Nigerian homes who cannot afford to pay N6000 to purchase a crate of the poultry products.\n\nThe average price of a crate of eggs has hit N6, 000 in various parts of Nigeria, from less than N3000 per crate 12-15 months ago.\n\nThe major driver of the rising price is the skyrocketing cost of inputs, particularly feed, maize and soybeans. High petrol prices have also been blamed for the price jump.\n\nA metric ton of maize currently goes for N710,000 as against N480,000 per metric ton in 2023, indicating a 48 percent price rise in one year, according to prices on AFEX Commodity website.\n\nSimilarly, a metric ton of soybeans now sells for N837,000 as against N425,000 in the corresponding period of 2023, representing a 97 percent increase in price over a one-year period. Poultry feed has exceeded N20, 000 per bag from N9,000 sold a year earlier.\n\nPius Aminu, chairman of the Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN), FCT Chapter, said the rising egg prices have resulted in nutritional deficiencies across the country.\n\nAminu urged the federal government to declare a state of emergency on egg production to ensure accessibility and affordability of the poultry product for citizens.\n\n“The federal government should urgently declare a state of emergency on egg production. The current decline is alarming, and the country cannot afford to rely on egg importation,” Aminu said.\n\nAminu noted that foreign exchange fluctuations and high petrol prices have driven eggs prices across the nation.\n\nHe noted that the situation has forced several farmers out of business, leading to the closure of hundreds of poultry farms and a rise in unemployment.\n\n“The poultry industry employs a significant number of people, especially in lower-income groups. Each farm typically has at least four to five staff, so the closure of 100 farms directly translates into higher unemployment rates,” Aminu further said.\n\nSunday Ezeobiora, president of the Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN), told BusinessDay earlier that owing to the high level of insecurity in the country, maize production has dropped by 50 percent in a year, estimating current production at 7 million metric tons (MT).\n\nHe noted that the poultry industry alone needs over four million metric tons of maize annually to meet farmers’ demand.\n\nEzeobiora noted that the record maize and soybean prices have shrunk the poultry industry value by 45 percent, from N10 trillion in 2022 to about N5.5 trillion currently.\n\nOnallo Akpan, an Abuja-based poultry farmer, said demand for eggs and poultry products has continued to slow as inflation has eroded consumers’ purchasing power and forced many to cut down on purchases. Nigeria’s headline inflation stood at 32.15 percent in August 2024.\n\n“From exchange volatility to the high cost of feeds, to supply chain disruption, to smuggling and the current low consumer demand induced by accelerating inflation and naira scarcity, it has been a chain of problems for the poultry industry since 2020,” said Akpa, who is also the director-general of PAN.\n\nHe further said that the declining demand for eggs, supply chain disruptions, high cost of feed, foreign exchange scarcity, avian influenza, and accelerating inflation are threatening the existence of several farms.\n\nHe urged the federal government to address the issue of insecurity to enable farmers to return to farms and grow enough maize for the entire country.\n\nThe country’s per capita daily protein intake is estimated to be 45.4g against the Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) minimum of 53.8g.\n\nIbrahim Kabiru, president of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), said due to debilitating issues affecting the poultry industry, he had to shut down one of his poultry farms in the North last year because he was running at a loss.",

   "Content": "Nigeria’s oil futures, Brass River and Qua Iboe, have surpassed the global benchmark, Brent crude, commanding a premium of $4 per barrel amid escalating geopolitical tensions and global economic uncertainties.\n\nOn Monday, Brass River, a sweet medium light crude, gained two percent to trade at $81.02 per barrel, while the Qua Iboe, a light sweet crude grade, also gained 1.59 percent to trade at $81.12 per barrel.\n\nExxonMobil produces Qua Iboe from numerous offshore fields and exports through the Qua Iboe terminal. The crude is known for its high quality and low sulfur content, making it a popular choice for refiners.\n\nNigerian crude futures were $4 higher than Brent, which traded at $1.72 or 2.2 percent at $77.34 per barrel by 6.pm Nigerian time on Monday.\n\nThis price advantage underscores the continued demand for Nigeria’s lighter, sweet crude, which is prized for its low sulfur content. The ease with which it can be refined into premium products like petrol and diesel makes it highly sought after by refiners.\n\n“Nigerian oil is one of the most sought-after in the global crude oil industry due to its unique quality. The low sulfur content makes it one of the finest worldwide,” noted Masters Energy Oil and Gas Limited.\n\nBusinessDay findings showed crude oil prices started falling at the start of the week following the latest economic news from China, which was interpreted as bearish for oil demand.\n\n“China faces persistent deflationary pressure due to weak domestic demand. The change of fiscal policy stance as indicated by the press conference yesterday (Saturday) would help to deal with such problems,” Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist of Hong Kong-based Pinpoint Asset Management told Reuters.\n\nChina, the world’s largest crude oil importer, accounted for the bulk of the 2024 downgrade as OPEC trimmed its growth forecast for the country to 580,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 650,000 bpd.\n\nOn Saturday, the Chinese government announced it would be injecting further stimulus into the economy, which should have been positive for oil prices.\n\nHowever, Beijing did not elaborate on the size of the stimulus package, which would be in the form of ‘significantly increased’ debt buying from local governments and subsidies to low-income households.\n\nApparently, the only thing traders wanted to hear from that update was exactly how much the Chinese government would spend on these additional stimulus measures.\n\nAs a result, oil traders forgot about the Middle East temporarily and focused on the world’s largest oil importer yet again, betting that whatever stimulus it offers would not be enough to prop up global stock and commodity markets.\n\nImplication for Nigeria\n\nThis development in oil markets could have significant implications for Nigeria, whose economy is heavily reliant on oil exports.\n\n“A decline in demand could translate to lower oil prices and consequently reduce government’s revenue. This could put pressure on the country’s budget and potentially lead to cuts in public services and infrastructure spending,” said Aisha Mohammed, an energy analyst at the Lagos-based Center for Development Studies.\n\nThe 2024 budget benchmarks oil above $78 per barrel. It also assumes that Nigeria will produce at least 1.78 million barrels per day (bpd).",

It will offer the opportunity to anyone who wants to train in the hospitality sector and also the institutions that train the hospitality sector to access affordable funds,” said CS Miano during the launch of the fund on Friday.\n\n“This is to place Kenya at the apex of the standards of hospitality. We do know that our hospitality is one of the pivotal points in the tourism sector and with this fund we will ensure that we have the training and to standardize the service that you get in this country,” said the CS.\n\nThe TTRF was established under the 2011 Tourism Act to provide financial support for individuals pursuing education in the tourism sector. Like HELB, the sustainability of the fund relies on loan repayments by beneficiaries, ensuring its ongoing ability to assist future students.\n\nThe hospitality sector, which includes tourism, is a key pillar of Kenya’s economy and a major earner of foreign exchange for the country, supplementing earnings from exports of tea, coffee and horticultural produce.\n\nKenya’s tourism sector grew significantly in 2023 boosted by a surge in international travel following the end of Covid-19 restrictions as well as the high-profile international conferences that were hosted in the country, including the Africa Climate Summit.",

   "source": "Nairametrics",
   "Content": "The Nigerian naira has been ranked among the worst-performing currencies in Sub-Saharan Africa for 2024.\n\nThis is according to the latest edition of Africa’s Pulse, a report by the World Bank.\n\nThe report noted that as of the end of August 2024, the naira had depreciated by approximately 43% year-to-date, positioning it alongside the Ethiopian birr and South Sudanese pound as one of the region’s weakest currencies.\n \nIt read: “Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria are among the worst performing in Africa this year, and their currencies continue weakening while demand for foreign exchange remains pressing. Measures to mitigate social unrest associated with the high cost of living in Angola (doubling of the minimum wage) and Nigeria (partially reinstating fuel subsidies) are putting pressure on their public finances.” \n\nHigh demand for dollar in parallel market\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the depreciation of the naira, including a surge in demand for U.S. dollars in the parallel market, limited dollar inflows, and delays in foreign exchange disbursements by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\n- The World Bank noted that demand for dollars by financial institutions, non-financial entities, and money managers has intensified pressure on the naira.\n\n- “The Angolan kwanza, Malawian kwacha, Nigerian naira, South Sudanese pound, and Zambian kwacha were the worst performing currencies in the region that year. More broadly, the weakening of most African currencies resulted from foreign exchange shortages as export proceeds were subdued and international debt payments increased. \n\n- “By August 2024, the Ethiopian birr, Nigerian naira, and South Sudanese pound were among the worst performers in the region. The Nigerian naira continued losing value, with a year-to-date depreciation of about 43% as of end-August. \n\n- “Surges in demand for US dollars in the parallel market, driven by financial institutions, money managers, and non-financial end-users, combined with limited dollar inflows and slow foreign exchange disbursements to currency exchange bureaus by the central bank explain the weakening of the naira,” the report stated.\n\nDespite the Nigerian government’s foreign exchange market reforms, including the liberalization of the official exchange rate in June 2023, the efforts have not been sufficient to stabilize the currency.\n\nThe naira’s depreciation is symptomatic of Nigeria’s broader economic issues, including dwindling foreign currency reserves and rising inflation.\n\nThe report highlights that the currency’s weakening has led to higher domestic prices, especially for imported goods, exacerbating the financial strain on Nigerian consumers.\n\nIn contrast, some African currencies, such as the Kenyan shilling and South African rand, which faced challenges in 2023, have shown signs of recovery in 2024.\n\nThe Kenyan shilling, for example, strengthened by 21% year-to-date by the end of August, making it one of the region’s top performers.\n\nHowever, foreign exchange shortages remain a concern for many African economies.\n\nWhat you should know \n\nThe devaluation of the naira has intensified inflationary pressures, making imported goods and services more expensive and reducing the purchasing power of Nigerians.\n\n- The currency’s decline, coupled with rising fuel prices, has particularly impacted the transportation sector, which relies heavily on imported petroleum products.\n\n- Despite fiscal reforms aimed at stabilizing the economy, the World Bank projects that inflation in Nigeria will remain elevated in the coming months.\n\n- Despite starting this week with a significant appreciation of over 5%, the naira fell hard on Tuesday as foreign exchange turnover further declines.\n\n- According to NAFEM data from FMDQ, the naira significantly depreciated against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, October 15, 2024, closing at N1,658.97/$1, marking a 6.39% decline from N1,552.92/$1 recorded the previous day on October 14, 2024.\n\nThis depreciation was accompanied by a sharp 36.62% drop in foreign exchange turnover, which fell from $343.71 million on Monday to $217.86 million on Tuesday.\n\nThe declining FX turnover suggests reduced dollar liquidity in the market, exacerbating the pressure on the naira.\n\nNairametrics earlier reported that the naira plummeted to a new record low, closing at N1,700 per dollar in the parallel market on Monday. This was a 0.29% drop from its previous rate of N1,695/$1 recorded on October 11.\n\nAlso, after recording a decrease twice consecutively, Nigeria’s headline inflation rate in September 2024 rose to 32.70%, up from 32.15% in August 2024, marking a 0.55% increase month-on-month.\n\nThis was according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) report which stated that inflation during the month was propelled by increases in transportation costs and food prices.",

   "source": "This Day (Nigeria)",
   "Content": "Nigeria’s petrol imports have dropped significantly in early October as the Dangote Refinery boosts its production to meet local demand. This information comes from an S&P Global Commodity Insights ship-tracking report released on Tuesday.\n\nThe report shows a dramatic decrease in petrol imports. In the first week of October, only 280,400 barrels of gasoline and blend stock entered Nigeria through a single Medium-Range vessel, a sharp contrast to August’s weekly average of 1.3 million barrels.\n\nThe trend continued into the second week of October. Only one tanker, carrying 290,567 barrels from Antwerp to Lagos, was reported. These two shipments pale compared to the 12 cargoes sent in the first half of August and September.\n\nSince October 8, no new gasoline shipments have arrived in Nigeria. This marks a significant disruption to the established fuel flow from Northwest Europe to West Africa, largely due to the Dangote Refinery’s increasing domestic production.\n\nA trade source commented: “There is no schedule for gasoline coming from Europe to Nigeria at the moment. The rest will have to come from whatever is in the Offshore Lome market.” They speculated that the new refinery might only meet up to a quarter of domestic demand.\n\nDespite this shift towards domestic production, the report cautions that Nigeria could still face a substantial fuel shortage without imported supply. Traders have expressed concerns about this potential deficit.",

The incentive framework, the time it takes for people to process investment and transactions is being cut. Incentives in the oil and gas sector including deep-waters have yielded investment by total of about $3 billion.  \n\n“Exxonmobil announced $10 billion. And there are Nigerians coming behind. The first place to look for foreign exchange and oil revenue is the oil sector. We are being promised by operators in the oil sectors 2 million barrels per day and, of course, the Dangote refinery,” Edun said.\n\nManufacturers Investments \n\nSpeaking further, Edun explained that similar investments are being seen in the manufacturing industry, with players in the industry ready to invest in the economy.\n\n- He said this readiness Is driven by the government’s incentives such as tax exemptions as well as tax reforms to drive growth and development.\n\n- According to him, a major manufacturer recently announced $2 billion investment in the sector.\n\n- “The other areas are manufacturing. Just last Saturday, I was with a major manufacturer. Of course, we’ve reeled out a whole range of incentives, tax reforms and exemptions and so forth for the manufacturing sector to help them with their cost. \n\n“ And he said, having noted and followed the reforms so far, they are now at the stage where the environment is now conducive for them to bring in $1.2 billion worth of investment across different areas of the economy. Of course, these are the specific incentives that has been unveiled, including cheaper funding,” Edun added.\n\nWhat you should know \n\nNairametrics previously reported that the federal government introduced tax reliefs for deep offshore oil and gas projects in the country as well as VAT exclusion on LPG, CNG, diesel and others.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance disclosed this via its official handle on X stating that the fiscal incentives were aimed at boosting investments in the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe orders from the Ministry are titled; Value Added Tax (VAT) Modification Order 2024 and Notice of Tax Incentives for Deep Offshore Oil & Gas Production, in accordance with the Oil & Gas Companies (Tax Incentives, Exemption, Remission, etc.) Order 2024.",

   "Content": "The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of MTN Nigeria, Module Kadri has stated that Nigeria’s telecommunications sector might lose investment like the oil sector if appropriate pricing is not guaranteed.\n\nSpeaking during a panel session at the 30th Nigerian Economic Summit (NES) in Abuja on Tuesday, Modupe Kadri, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of MTN Nigeria, explained that rising inflation and foreign exchange challenges have significantly impacted the telecommunications industry’s ability to operate efficiently.\n\nKadri explained that the situation is particularly difficult because most of the industry’s products are imported.\n \nHe noted that tariff hikes have already occurred in the petroleum and electricity sectors and questioned why similar increases have not been permitted in the telecommunications industry.\n\nHe stated that the government must create a level playing field to support the survival of businesses.\n\nIn his words, “Our business is mainly dependent on forex, so customers need to understand that for you to get the services that you desire, it costs money.” \n\n”When people have to invest in the country and are not able to monetise their investment, it cannot work.” \n\n”The only way that this economy will thrive is if there is appropriate pricing such that investments in the sector are guaranteed.” \n\n”The telecommunications industry contributes 16 per cent to the GDP, and it is not something that you mess around with.” \n\n”If we are not careful, what happened to the oil industry, which led to loss of investments will happen to telecommunications, and the industry will come to a halt. It’s not rocket science,”\n\nCalls for telecoms tariff review \n\nPlayers in Nigeria’s telecommunications industry have been angling for an increase in tariffs as inflation and foreign exchange woes increase the cost of operations in the business.\n\n- Telecommunication operators in Nigeria previously stated that their services are long overdue for price increases, as they have not adjusted prices upward in the past 11 years. The last time telecoms tariffs were reviewed was as far back as 2013.\n\n- They noted that the telecom sector is the only industry that has not reviewed its pricing despite rising inflation and other economic pressures that justify an increase. They attributed this to regulatory restrictions that have prevented them from adjusting prices accordingly.\n\nThe sector also grapples with several other challenges, such as multiple taxation and regulations, high Right of Way (RoW) charges, inadequate power supply, and frequent vandalism of telecommunications infrastructure.\n\n- In a recent interview, prominent Economist and CEO of Financial Derivative Company, Bismarck Rewane supported plans to increase telecoms tariffs noting it is the only way to guarantee sustainability in the business.\n\n- Rewane noted that the current tariff structure is limiting the operators’ ability to invest in infrastructure, leading to a decline in the quality of their services in recent times.\n\nStarlink increase in subscription: Recently, Starlink Internet services increased its monthly subscription for Nigerians by as much as 97% from N38,000 to N75,000.\n\nThe company attributed the increase to excessive inflation in Nigeria.",

   "Content": "Kenya has initiated plans to restrict the direct export of valuable minerals in their raw forms from the country.\n\nThis follows the ongoing construction of mega gold processing plant worth around Sh5.8 billion which authorities say, portends a major policy shift to increase revenue for the government.\n\nAccording to Kenya's Principal Secretary for Mining, Elijah Mwangi, the building of the gold and granite plants is projected to be completed mid-next year.\n\nHe also added that gold, gemstones, and granite will be the first batch of minerals to be exported from the processing plant after value addition.\n\nThe gold refining plant is a multibillion - shilling deal recently sealed between Kenya and a league of private investors which will be situated in Kakamega and a granite processing plant worth Sh2.5 billion which will be located in Vihiga County.\n\nKenya, with this update will be joining about 10 other African nations that have already placed restrictions or tightened regulations on the exports of valuable minerals from their regions..\n\nOver the years, the raw exports of these commodities have been frowned at following the loss of funds by the continent as processing is carried out elsewhere.\n\nAccording to McKinsey, Africa could earn between USD 200 million and USD 2 billion of additional annual revenue by 2030 and create up to 3.8 million jobs by building a competitive, low-carbon manufacturing sector.\n\nAfrica currently boasts of a huge share of the global mineral reserves – including 92% of platinum, 56% of cobalt, 54% of manganese and 36% of chromium. These minerals are also utilized in green technologies such as electric vehicle (EV) batteries and wind turbines.\n\nCurrently, these minerals are largely exported in their raw forms from Africa where they are refined abroad. Africa therefore needs to increase its chances of creating a value addition chain by developing its processing capacity which will allow the export of intermediate goods or final products.\n\nAccording to experts, this will drive economic development on the continent by creating jobs and resulting in higher tax and income revenues.\n\nAccording to Reuters, about $15.1 billion worth of gold from Africa, was exported to the UAE in 2016, more than any other country and up from $1.3 billion in 2006.\n\nReuters also confirmed that there were also no official records of the gold exports from African states and according to five trade economists interviewed, this revealed the huge volume of gold which left the continent with no taxes being paid to the states that produce them.\n\nSome African countries that have implemented policies to restrict the export of raw gold and other minerals, in an effort to promote local processing and value addition, include:\n\nStakeholders have however, called for caution as Africa takes this dire step towards protecting its natural resources. The calls comes amid the continent's high infrastructural deficits .\n\nAccording to Benedikt Sobotka, CEO of the Eurasian Resources Group (ERG), there were no automatic benefits from the export bans placed on the raw minerals following the number of African countries that have almost immediately abandoned the policy soon after implementation.",

   "source": "Ghana Web",
   "Content": "Nigeria’s currency is the cheapest that it has been in decades, thanks to painful but necessary economic reforms to put the nation on a long-term path to recovery.\n\n“The naira’s real exchange rate is at its most competitive in at least 20 years,” said Chief Economist Indermit Gill. “This is a great opportunity for the private sector,” he told the Nigerian Economic Summit Group on Monday in the capital, Abuja.\n\nCurrency and fuel subsidy reforms by President Bola Tinubu last year have pulled Africa’s largest oil producer back from the brink of fiscal collapse, Gill said, after years of misrule left Nigeria with the largest number of people living in extreme poverty in the world.\n\nThe naira’s value has fallen by more than 70% to around 1,553 per dollar on Monday from 465 per dollar before the reforms, the cost of gasoline has more than quintupled and the central bank has stopped printing money to finance government spending.\n\n“This is only the beginning. Nigeria will need to stay the course for at least another 10 to 15 years to transform its economy,” he informed the audience, which muttered audibly at this warning. “It is very difficult to do these things, but the rewards are massive.”\n\nForeign exchange rules to prop up the naira ended by Tinubu after taking office in May 2023, plus fuel subsidies that he has also rolled back were costing Nigeria 10 trillion naira a year, worth around $15 billion at the time.\n\n“You can do a lot with $15 billion,” Gill said.\n\nWhile welcomed by international investors, the devaluation of the naira and removal of fuel subsidies has fanned inflation and caused a cost-of-living crisis for ordinary Nigerians, sparking protests in recent months that led to a deadly crackdown by security forces.\n\n“The government must do everything in its power to protect the most vulnerable citizens against hardships,” Gill said, recommending that it ramp up short-term payments to poor households and roll out a social safety net financed with the money saved on fuel subsidies.\n\nThe central bank, which has raised interest rates aggressively to curb inflation and quell naira volatility, must also stay focused on price pressures, while building up foreign reserves and resisting what he called the “lure of short-term capital inflows that might push up the naira value too quickly and crimp non-oil growth.”\n\n“If you stay the course you will surely reap the rewards,” Gill said. “Failure sets back the continent and ruins the future of another generation.",

   "source": "Ghana Web",
   "Content": "The World Bank says Sub-Sahara African governments’ debt remains high and riskier but notes that some progress has been made in debt restructuring.\n\nIn its October 2024 Africa Pulse Report, the World Bank said over the past decades, external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt in Sub-Saharan Africa has been increasing, and it has more than quadrupled since 2006.\n\nIn 2022, the total external PPG debt reached US$462 billion, compared to US$108 billion in 2006.\n\nRising external debt mirrors the changes in the composition of external debt creditors.\n\nMultilateral financing has increased over a protracted period among LICs in the region.\n\nTheir share of multilateral financing in PPG external debt has increased since 2015 and has remained above 50 percent since 2019.\n\nOverall, the share of multilateral debt in external PPG debt for LICs increased by 12 percentage points between 2015 and 2022 and only 5 percentage points for middle-income countries (MICs) over the same period.\n\nThe share of external financing from the bilateral Paris Club creditors decreased in Sub-Saharan Africa, while the share from bilateral non–Paris Club creditors increased slightly, the report said.\n\nIn 2006, bilateral Paris Club creditors accounted for 22 per cent of external debt in Sub-Saharan African countries, which decreased to 5 per cent by 2022.\n\nIn contrast, the share of bilateral non–Paris Club creditors increased from 15 to 16 per cent during the same period.\n\nOn the back of the changing creditor landscape is a significant concentration of holdings by a few major creditors.\n\nBefore the global financial crisis, Sub-Saharan Africa’s top six bilateral creditors were France, China, the United States, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait.\n\nHowever, by the end of 2022, the creditor composition changed, with China—a non–Paris Club member—leading as the most significant official bilateral creditor to SSA, with its debt stock increasing from 3 per cent in 2006 to 12 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe debt burden increased as countries resorted more to market financing.\n\nBond financing has increased as a source for Sub-Saharan African MICs’ external PPG debt, leveraging their access to capital markets.\n\nThe share of bonds in the total external PPG debt of MICs increased by 13 percentage points between 2006 and 2022.\n\nSince 2007, 17 countries in the region have issued Eurobonds to private creditors. After a two-year hiatus from international markets, four countries (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, and Senegal) resumed issuance of sovereign bonds in early 2024, with some of these issuances to buy back and refinance Eurobonds and commercial loans falling due.\n\nHowever, the issuance came at a higher price tag as a result of higher global interest rates rather than bigger country risk spreads.\n\nFor instance, the coupon of the new Eurobond issued by Kenya in February is 9.75 per cent, compared to the 6.875 per cent for the Eurobond maturing in 2024.\n\nEurobond redemptions remain high in 2024 and are expected to increase in 2025.\n\nIn 2024, eight countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are expected to amortise their sovereign bonds with a cumulative value of US$4.5 billion.\n\nThree countries in AFE had the largest sovereign bond redemptions, with a total share of 90 per cent of the bonds issued in 2014— namely, Kenya (US$2 billion), Ethiopia (US$1 billion), and Zambia (US$1 billion).\n\nThe region will continue its high bond redemptions in 2025, with a cumulative bond capitalisation of US$5.2 billion.\n\nAngola and Nigeria account for more than 50 per cent of the redemptions.\n\nOverall, bond redemptions are projected to increase steeply in the region in 2024–25, reflecting redemptions of Eurobonds, before decreasing in 2026.\n\nThe higher redemptions in 2024 and 2025 are expected to drive up governments’ financing needs, in the context of higher market rates, as they potentially account for a significant proportion of government revenues in some Sub-Saharan African countries.\n\nThe restructuring of external debt in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Zambia is expected to result in lower payments as bond exchanges are finalised.\n\nGreater reliance on domestic bonds amid restricted access to global capital markets.\n\nIn parallel, Sub-Saharan African countries have increased their reliance on domestic debt markets, whose continued development enabled countries to finance larger deficits despite the low tax base in the region.\n\nBased on the World Bank-IMF LIC Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) database, the median public domestic debt-to-GDP in Sub-Saharan African countries increased from 8 per cent in 2012 to 22 per cent in 2022.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2021, public domestic debt-to-GDP in LICs rose by around 15 percentage points to 23 per cent, while for lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) it increased by 10 percentage points and reached 19 per cent in 2021.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the accumulation of public domestic debt at a much faster pace given countries’ need for greater financial resources to protect people and jobs.\n\nHowever, since 2023, the median public domestic debt-to-GDP among countries in Sub-Saharan Africa using the LIC-DSF has stabilised, and it is projected to reach 20 per cent of GDP in LICs and 17 per cent of GDP in LMICs in 2024.\n\nGovernment financing needs to remain high. Public gross financing needs (GFNs) are expected to remain higher than in the pre-pandemic era.\n\nFinancing needs for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa increased sharply after the COVID-19 pandemic until 2022, as countries ramped up resources to support economic recovery. The higher energy and food prices further amplified government financing needs.\n\nFor LICs in Sub-Saharan Africa, the average GFN was almost 13 per cent of GDP by the end of 2022, with 11 countries (Benin, Burundi, The Gambia, Ghana, Mozambique, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Togo, and Zambia) having GFNs exceeding 14 per cent of GDP, a level consistent with a higher probability of distress in countries using the LIC-DSF.\n\nGFNs in LICs in Sub-Saharan Africa decreased to an average of 10 per cent in 2023, and this is projected to be broadly stable in 2024 as government finance pressure eases and primary deficits taper.\n\nGovernment debt is stabilising at high levels. Public debt in Sub-Saharan Africa was four times higher in 2023 compared to 2006, reflecting external and domestic debt stabilising at elevated levels and high GFNs.\n\nThe average nominal level of debt in 2006–19 was around US$565 billion, and the current nominal public debt at end-2023 stood at US$1.25 trillion.\n\nIt is expected to drop slightly to US$1.18 trillion at end-2024.\n\nSince 2013, accommodative global financial conditions and a search for yield have facilitated larger volumes of financing to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFurthermore, the collapse in oil prices in 2014–16 led to exchange rate depreciations and wider primary deficits that pushed public debt upward.\n\nDuring the pandemic and post-pandemic recovery period, debt levels increased to respond to higher financing needs.\n\nHowever, the context has changed after the COVID-19 crisis, as persistent global inflation and tighter monetary policies have led to higher (domestic and external) borrowing costs for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and put pressure on exchange rates.\n\nThe median total public debt-to-GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa increased from 37 per cent in 2006 to 52 per cent in 2019, before the COVID-19 shock, and further increased to 57 per cent in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the median debt-to-GDP ratio for LICs in Sub-Saharan Africa reached 57 per cent, while it reached 64 per cent for MICs.\n\nThe debt burden remains high. Sub-Saharan Africa’s total debt service levels have increased steadily since 2006, adversely affecting fiscal space and increasing vulnerability to shocks, especially for countries that have gained access to the international bond market and other non-concessional financing sources.\n\nTotal annual debt service increased by US$31 billion between 2006 and 2022.\n\nAdditionally, the expiration of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative—which suspended and rescheduled debt service due during 2020–21—along with high global interest rates led to a large increase in debt service in 2023, amounting to US$51 billion, resulting in a total cumulative increase of US$82 billion.\n\nThe highest increase was in AFE countries, where total debt service in 2006–22 increased by US$81 billion.\n\nThe ratios of total debt service to exports and debt service to revenue in Sub-Saharan Africa are 32 and 49 per cent, respectively, for 2023, and are estimated to adjust downward in 2024 to 22 and 34 per cent, respectively.\n\nAs a result, external debt distress risks in Sub-Saharan Africa have increased since 2015.\n\nThe risk of external debt distress in the region has surged as the share of countries at high risk of or in debt distress in the LIC-DSF increased from 27 per cent in 2015 to 53 per cent in 2024.\n\n2021, no country in Sub-Saharan Africa has been classified as low risk, and the share of countries at high risk or in debt distress reached a peak of 61 per cent in 2021.\n\nRecently, the risk of debt distress has improved in a few countries due to debt relief.\n\nDuring 2023, Mauritania and Somalia’s risk of debt distress improved to “moderate,” from “high” and “in debt distress,” respectively.\n\nIn contrast, Ghana was downgraded to “in debt distress” in May 2023 in the context of the ongoing debt restructuring.\n\nTo restore debt sustainability and rebuild fiscal space, several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are implementing comprehensive debt restructurings in the context of the Common Framework and beyond.\n\nChad, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Zambia have applied for external debt treatments under the Common Framework.\n\nRestructuring agreements were reached with official bilateral creditors in all the countries except Ethiopia, where negotiations were delayed due to the country’s internal conflict.\n\nNegotiations with official and private creditors continue, with a few countries reaching an agreement.\n\nChad reached an agreement with all its main creditors in November 2022.\n\nThe Government of Zambia agreed on a state-contingent debt treatment with its official creditors in October 2023 and concluded a bond exchange in June 2024.\n\nNegotiations with other private creditors are being finalized.\n\nThe Government of Ghana also concluded negotiations with its official creditors in June 2024 and has reached a preliminary deal with bondholders.\n\nProgress on debt restructuring negotiations in these countries allowed the IMF to conclude financing programmes and the World Bank to provide large positive net flows at highly concessional or grant terms.\n\nBeyond the Common Framework, Malawi outlined a strategy to restructure its external debt and restore debt sustainability in July 2022.\n\nThe authorities are negotiating with commercial and official bilateral creditors and have recently reached an agreement with China—a major bilateral creditor—for a restructured amount of US$206 million (1.6 per cent of 2023 GDP) to reduce the country’s debt service needs.\n\nIn December 2023, Somalia received a US$4.5 billion debt relief package from its creditors, including the World Bank, as a result of the country’s Completion Point under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.\n\nThe debt relief package aims to support the country’s economic recovery and ensure debt sustainability.",

   "Content": "Global ratings agencies, Fitch and Moody’s have sparked confidence in Ghana’s Long-Term Local-Currency (LTLC), raising the country’s credit ratings from the previous ones.\n\nWhile Fitch upgraded the country’s Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) from ‘CCC’ to ‘CCC+’, Moody’s raised the ratings from the previous levels of ‘Caa3’ and ‘Ca to ‘Caa2.’\n\nThe upgrade was driven by the country’s extensive debt restructuring, including the recently completed Eurobond exchange, the two ratings agencies said, noting that the process had eased the government’s financial pressures.\n\nRegarding outlook, Fitch noted that it typically did not assign outlooks to IDRs of sovereigns with a rating of ‘CCC+’ or below, while Moody’s shifted the country’s outlook from ‘stable’ to ‘positive.’\n\n“The upgrade of Ghana’s LTLC IDR to ‘CCC+’ reflects our increased confidence that the likelihood of another default on Ghana’s LC debt is being reduced with the completion of the Eurobond restructuring, as this further unlocks access to concessional international finance,” Fitch noted.\n\n“The ‘positive outlook reflects the potential for liquidity risk to ease amid ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts supported by an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme,’ Moody’s said in a statement last Friday.\n\nEarlier this month, Dr Mohammed Amin Adam, Ghana’s Finance Minister, indicated that the country would resume the payment of debt owed its Eurobond holders, following the successful completion of its US$13 billion external debt.\n\nIt also came on the backdrop of the country reaching an agreement with the Staff Mission of the IMF on the third review of its ongoing Extended Credit Facility (ECF), of which the external debt restructuring forms a major part.\n\nThis is to help in Ghana’s recovery from a near US$30bn debt default in 2022, as the restructuring is expected to cut Ghana’s debt by $4.7bn and offer cash flow relief worth $4.4bn during the IMF programme.\n\n“By the 98 per cent we’ve achieved, we’ve all consented to the exchange, but the actual exchange will take place over the next two weeks, and once we exchange, it means that we can start servicing our debts,” he said.\n\n“We’ll not service at the levels we’d have done because of the reduction in the interest rate and principal… with the Official Bilateral Creditors, the servicing of the debt has been postponed until after 2028,” he added.\n\nGhana’s economy has shown signs of recovery, with growth hitting 6.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2024, the highest in five years, the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) has noted.\n\nAt the end of its two-week long third review of Ghana’s programme, Mr Stephane Roudet, Mission Chief for Ghana stated that the country’s economic growth in the first half of 2024 was much higher than initially envisaged.",

   "Content": "The Institute of Energy Security (IES) has backed calls for the merger of the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) and the Energy Commission of Ghana.\n\nAccording to IES, combining the two regulatory bodies into a single entity will enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of energy regulation and lead to saving cost.\n\nExecutive Director of IES, Nana Amoasi IV, has said a unified regulatory authority would significantly improve policy formulation and implementation within the sector.\n\nHe noted that this is critical, given the current challenges facing Ghana’s energy landscape.\n\n“Today’s power sector is played around regional bases. And in the West African power pool, all their regulators relative to the power, it is only one regulator. You don’t find PURC at one end and you don’t find an energy commission at one end. For policy formulation and implementation, I get from one command desk. So that is a good call,” he was quoted by citinewsroom.com.\n\nNana Amoasi IV also added that merging the PURC and the Energy Commission would address some of the energy challenges by streamlining decision-making processes and reducing bureaucratic delays.",

   "Content": "The Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Zacch Adedeji has stated that the tax reforms being executed by the Federal government will not introduce new taxes or increase the tax rate for existing ones.\n\nAdedeji disclosed this during an interactive session with the Senate Committee on Finance in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nHe reassured Nigerians that the ongoing tax reforms would not involve the introduction of new taxes or any increases to existing ones.\n \nHe said, “Tax reform will not introduce any tax or increase the percentage of the existing ones but it will reduce the number of taxes being paid by Nigerians. \n\n“No agency will be merged in the process of carrying out the reform and no job will be taken from anybody. \n\n“The tax reform basically seeks to increase the simplicity and efficiency of tax administration in Nigeria,” \n\nAdedeji stated that four executive bills had already been submitted to both chambers of the National Assembly to formalize the tax reform.\n\nHe explained that the bills include the Nigeria Tax Bill, Nigeria Tax Administration Act (amendment) Bill, Nigeria Revenue Service Bill, and the Joint Revenue Board (Establishment) Bill.\n\nHe noted that once passed, the bills would help harmonize the country’s multiple tax laws, driving efficiency and modernization.\n\nAccording to him, the legislation would simplify tax laws, create synergy among relevant agencies, and enhance transparency in revenue collection. Additionally, the bills aim to align with international standards and expand Nigeria’s tax base.\n\nIn response to a question about why the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) would be renamed the Nigeria Revenue Service (NRS) in one of the proposed bills, Adedeji explained that the current name does not fully reflect the agency’s scope of services.\n\nResponse from the senate\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman of the committee, Sen. Sani Musa, stated that the purpose of the interactive session was for the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to brief the committee on the objectives of the tax reform bills.\n\n“Tax reforms are central to the government’s agenda and require meaningful contributions from all stakeholders,” Musa said.\n\nHe praised the FIRS leadership for achieving the revenue targets set for the fiscal year and encouraged them to exceed those targets.",

   "Url": "https://www.myjoyonline.com/fitch-assigns-ghanas-new-dollar-bonds-at-ccc/",
   "source": "My Joy Online",
   "Content": "Fitch Ratings has assigned Ghana's new US dollar bonds, issued on 9 October 2024, a 'CCC+' rating.\n\nFitch also has upgraded Ghana's Long-Term Local-Currency (LTLC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'CCC+' from 'CCC'.\n\nFitch has affirmed Ghana's Long-Term Foreign-Currency (LTFC) IDR at 'RD'. Fitch typically does not assign Outlooks to IDRs of sovereigns with a rating of 'CCC+' or below.\n\nFitch has also affirmed the 'CC' rating on Ghana's US dollar-denominated notes partially guaranteed by the International Development Association (IDA), part of the World Bank Group, due October 2030, and subsequently withdrawn the rating.\n\nThe issue rating for the IDA-partially guaranteed note maturing in 2030 has been withdrawn as the note will no longer exist because of its restructuring.\n\nEurobond Exchange Concluded\n\nGhana has successfully concluded a debt exchange for its 15 outstanding non-performing Eurobonds, including the IDA-partially guaranteed notes. This follows consent reached on 98.58% of the total outstanding amount, and each series has received consent representing more than 92% of outstanding principal, meeting the respective collective action clause thresholds.\n\nAs a result, the 15 Eurobonds have been exchanged for five new bonds and distribution to eligible holders was completed on 10 October 2024. The assignment of a 'CCC+' rating to these five bonds reflects our assessment of Ghana's expected credit profile after completion of the whole debt restructuring, with a declining debt supported by ongoing fiscal consolidation, and elevated liquidity risks with interest spending relative to revenue which is still high.\n\nSignificant Reduction in Terms\n\nIn exchange for the 15 outstanding Eurobonds with a total face value of USD13.1 billion, investors were offered a set of new bonds, with two options. Under the 'disco' option, a nominal haircut of 37% applies on all claims, which then is restructured into two new notes - a step-up coupon amortising note due 2029 and a step-up coupon amortising note due 2035. The step-up coupon rates range from 5% to 6%.\n\nUnder the 'par' option there is no nominal haircut but claims are restructured to a 1.5% amortising note due 2037. Both the 'disco' option and 'par' option receive a zero-coupon amortising note due 2026 and a zero-coupon note due 2030 in exchange of past-due interests. The restructuring does not provide for value-recovery instruments. Tenders representing a total of USD994.8 million opted for the par option (below the cap of USD1.6 billion).\n\nSubstantial Debt Relief\n\nThe Eurobond exchange entails a reduction in Ghana's FC debt stock (including PDIs) of around 6% of estimated 2024 GDP. FC debt service is reduced by USD3.5 billion over 2024-2026. Interest payments are reduced by 1.3% of GDP in 2024, 0.9% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026 compared with interest payments due under the original terms of the bonds. These estimates do not factor in the cost of rolling over bonds (at increased coupon rates, given market conditions) that would have matured in 2023-2026, implying larger actual debt relief.\n\nDeclining Debt\n\n Assuming similar treatment of FC commercial debt that still needs to be restructured, the debt stock reduction would reach 7% of estimated 2024 GDP. This, combined with a strong medium-term growth forecast and ongoing fiscal consolidation, will contribute to a decline in central government's debt, to 70% of GDP in 2024 and 68% in 2025 and 2026, from 77% of GDP in 2023.\n\nOfficial Treatment Adds to Relief\n\nThe Eurobond treatment was designed to be comparable in scale (although likely different in terms of parameters of present value reduction, debt-service reduction over the IMF programme period, and duration) to the official sector treatment, for which terms of the June 2024 memorandum of understanding have not been disclosed. Incorporating the official treatment would entail a further reduction of the debt-service burden.\n\nRemaining FC Debt in Default\n\nThe affirmation of LTFC IDR at 'RD' reflects Ghana remaining in default on some of its external commercial debt, pending a restructuring. The Eurobond exchange covenants contain a most-favoured creditor clause that restricts the country from restructuring debt with its remaining creditors on more favourable terms (on a present value basis) without offering consideration of equivalent value to noteholders. We estimate Ghana will complete its external debt restructuring by early 2025.\n\nLTLC IDR Upgraded\n\nThe upgrade of Ghana's LTLC IDR to 'CCC+' reflects our increased confidence that the likelihood of another default on Ghana's LC debt is being reduced with the completion of the Eurobond restructuring, as this further unlocks access to concessional international finance. On 4 October 2024, Ghana and the IMF reached a staff-level agreement on the third review of the extended credit facility, unlocking USD360 million once approved by the IMF board.",
